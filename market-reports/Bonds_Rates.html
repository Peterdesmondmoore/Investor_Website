    <h3>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h3>

    <h3>Key Investment Opportunities</h3>
    <p>
        Identification of contrarian, momentum, mean reversion, or divergence plays is contingent on available CoT data, which is absent.
    </p>

    <h3>Asset Class Summaries</h3>
    <p>
        Detailed summaries for Equities, Bonds, Currencies, Commodities, and Volatility are not possible as the input DataFrame was empty.
