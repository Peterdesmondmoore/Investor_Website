    <h1>Subject: Weekly State of the Market - CoT Data Missing</h1>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The Commitments of Traders (CoT) reports, specified as the basis for this analysis, were provided as an empty DataFrame. Without the actual CoT data (e.g., speculative net positions, changes, COT Index, or Z-scores for various assets), it is impossible to generate a 'State of the Market' summary, identify macro risks, or pinpoint investment opportunities as requested.
    </p>

    <h2>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h2>
    <p>
        Cannot be generated. Critical CoT data required for assessing market complacency, economic slowdown signals, volatility shock risks, and interest rate/inflation risks is absent.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Investment Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
        Cannot be identified. The analysis of speculative positioning to pinpoint contrarian, momentum, mean reversion, or divergence plays is contingent on the availability of CoT data, which was not provided.
