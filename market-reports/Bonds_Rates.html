        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The latest Commitments of Traders (COT) data for Sovereign Bonds & Rates reveals a nuanced yet significant shift in market sentiment. Speculative bearishness is broadly retreating in short-term rates, while remaining firm or increasing in long-term bonds. This divergence points to complex expectations around future rate trajectories and potential market volatility.
