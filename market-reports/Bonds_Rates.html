    <h1>Subject: State of the Market - CoT Data Missing</h1>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
        **Unable to Generate Report: Commitments of Traders (CoT) Data Missing.**
        The provided input shows an "Empty DataFrame" for the Commitments of Traders (CoT) reports. As such, the necessary data on speculative positioning, changes in open interest, and net long/short positions across various asset classes is absent. Without this fundamental data, it is impossible to perform the requested analysis to characterize market sentiment, identify macro risks, or pinpoint specific investment opportunities.
    </p>

    <h2>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h2>
    <p>
        Analysis for key macro risks such as market complacency/overextension, economic slowdown signals, potential volatility shocks, or interest rate/inflation risks relies entirely on granular CoT positioning data. For instance, assessing market complacency requires knowing extreme net-long positions in risk assets. Identifying economic slowdowns necessitates observing broad speculative bearishness in cyclical commodities and indices. Detecting volatility shock risks involves analyzing speculative positioning in VIX futures. Without this data, no such risks can be identified or supported.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Investment Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
        The identification of actionable investment opportunities—whether contrarian (short squeeze potential), momentum (trend continuation), mean reversion (long exhaustion), or divergence plays—is directly derived from the CoT data. These opportunities are based on identifying extreme speculative positioning (net-long or net-short), significant shifts in conviction, or conflicting signals between related instruments. Without the underlying CoT reports, no such opportunities can be identified or presented with supporting rationale.
