        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The latest Commitments of Traders (CoT) data for Livestock reveals a consistent and deepening bearish sentiment among speculators. All major livestock contracts (Feeder Cattle, Lean Hogs, and Live Cattle) exhibit net-short speculative positioning, coupled with ongoing reductions in net-long exposure. The environment is characterized by sustained bearish conviction within the agricultural protein sector, lacking extreme positioning or immediate signals for contrarian plays.

            <h4>Macro Risk Dashboard</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Livestock Sector Weakness:</strong> Widespread and deepening bearish speculative sentiment across all livestock markets indicates underlying sector-specific concerns. Feeder Cattle, Lean Hogs, and Live Cattle all show significant net-short speculative positions (e.g., Lean Hogs: -143,316 contracts [Spec_Positions_Net_All]) and continued reduction in net-long exposure (e.g., Lean Hogs: ΔSpec_Net_Position -5,040 WoW). This points to potential weakened demand or oversupply issues within the agricultural protein sector, despite 'Normal Conditions' [Signal_Commentary].</li>

            <h4>Key Investment Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Livestock Bearish Momentum:</strong> Speculators are maintaining and increasing their net-short exposure across Feeder Cattle, Lean Hogs, and Live Cattle, with all showing negative changes in net-long positions WoW (e.g., Live Cattle: ΔSpec_Net_Position -3,353 WoW). This consistent trend, combined with increasing open interest [ΔOI], suggests strong market participation reinforcing the bearish momentum. This offers tactical shorting opportunities in line with prevailing speculative conviction in the livestock complex.</li>
