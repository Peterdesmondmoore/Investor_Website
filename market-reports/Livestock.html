        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>

Live Cattle shows extreme bullish positioning (24,000 contracts, COT Index: 88), signaling potential overextension. Conversely, Feeder Cattle is at an extreme net-short (-8,000 contracts, COT Index: 15), setting up for a short squeeze. Lean Hogs maintains strong bullish conviction (17,500 contracts, COT Index: 68). The overall environment is one of sector-specific extremes rather than broad directional consensus.
