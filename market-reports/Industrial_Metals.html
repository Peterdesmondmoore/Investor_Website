        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The Commitments of Traders (CoT) report for Industrial Metals reveals a distinctly bifurcated market. Speculative sentiment is overwhelmingly bearish across key cyclical commodities like Copper, Lithium Hydroxide, and Cobalt, signaling deep economic caution. Conversely, Steel-HRC and Aluminum MWP maintain moderate bullish conviction. The overall environment points to significant downside risks to global growth, while simultaneously presenting compelling contrarian opportunities in deeply oversold assets.

            <h4>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic Slowdown Signals:</strong> Widespread speculative net-short positioning in Copper (CoT Index NT: 11.23, Z-score: -1.74), Lithium Hydroxide (CoT Index NT: 16.67, Z-score: -1.72), and Cobalt (CoT Index NT: 12.50, Z-score: -1.76) signals a potential broad industrial downturn and weakening demand outlook.</li>
                <li><strong>Deflationary Pressure Risk:</strong> The pervasive bearishness in core industrial metals suggests declining commodity prices, which implies reduced inflationary pressures. This scenario could lead to more accommodative central bank policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Market Breadth:</strong> This analysis is confined to Industrial Metals, precluding insights into broader market sentiment across Equities, Fixed Income, Currencies, and Volatility.</li>

            <h4>Key Investment Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrarian Longs (Short Squeeze Potential):</strong> Extreme speculative net-short positioning in Copper (CoT Index NT: 11.23), Lithium Hydroxide (CoT Index NT: 16.67), and Cobalt (CoT Index NT: 12.50) creates high short-squeeze potential. A positive sentiment shift could trigger rapid price rallies.</li>
                <li><strong>Steel-HRC Momentum (Trend Continuation):</strong> Speculative net-longs in Steel-HRC (CoT Index NT: 77.29, Z-score: 0.95) indicate strong, but not overextended, bullish conviction, suggesting potential for continued upward trend.</li>
                <li><strong>Cobalt Divergence Play:</strong> The 'Managed Money and Swap Dealer Divergence' flag for Cobalt (flag_mm_swap_divergence = 1) points to conflicting institutional positioning, often preceding a trend change or consolidation, offering a nuanced trade.</li>
