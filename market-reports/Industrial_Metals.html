                <li><strong>Copper Upside Momentum:</strong> Speculators aggressively increased net-longs (+184 contracts), indicating strong conviction for further price appreciation. Significant open interest growth (+12,683 contracts) supports this.</li>
                <li><strong>Lithium Hydroxide Short Squeeze Potential:</strong> Commercial hedgers are heavily reducing net-short positions (+2,233 contracts WoW), setting the stage for a short squeeze if new bullish catalysts emerge.</li>

            <h4 style="font-size: 10pt;">Key Risks</h4>
            <ul style="font-size: 10pt;">
                <li><strong>Copper Commercial Resistance:</strong> While speculators are bullish, commercial hedgers significantly increased net-short positions (-3,692 contracts WoW), signaling strong price resistance or expectation of a correction.</li>
                <li><strong>Cobalt Bearish Persistence:</strong> Managed Money traders increased net-short positions (-345 contracts WoW), reinforcing a bearish outlook and indicating potential for continued price decline.</li>

    <h3>Asset Class Summaries</h3>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4 style="font-size: 10pt;">Copper-#1</h4>
        <ul style="font-size: 10pt;">
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong> Dominantly bullish, significantly increasing net-long positions to +21,915 contracts (+184 WoW). This reflects high conviction.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong> Strongly bearish, increasing net-short positions to -51,763 contracts (-3,692 WoW). They are actively hedging against rising prices.</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Strong speculative buying momentum faces aggressive commercial selling. This divergence suggests a critical juncture where price direction will be determined by which side dominates.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4 style="font-size: 10pt;">Lithium Hydroxide</h4>
        <ul style="font-size: 10pt;">
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong> Remain net-long at +3,731 contracts but slightly reduced longs (-220 WoW), signaling a minor cooling in bullish conviction.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong> Remain heavily net-short at -9,861 contracts but significantly covered shorts (+2,233 WoW). This suggests reduced bearish hedging.</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Commercial short covering offers a potential floor. Speculators easing longs hints at consolidation, but a sudden shift could spark a rally.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4 style="font-size: 10pt;">Cobalt</h4>
        <ul style="font-size: 10pt;">
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong> Dominantly bearish, increasing net-short positions to -1,652 contracts (-345 WoW). This indicates growing negative sentiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong> Remain net-short at -1,244 contracts but covered some shorts (+303 WoW). They are becoming less bearish.</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Speculative bearishness dominates, suggesting further downside. Commercials reducing shorts might signal a potential, albeit distant, bottom.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4 style="font-size: 10pt;">ALUMINUM MWP</h4>
        <ul style="font-size: 10pt;">
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong> Slightly net-short at -408 contracts but reduced shorts (+528 WoW), moving towards neutral.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong> Remain heavily net-short at -10,668 contracts but covered shorts (+320 WoW).</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Both groups are reducing bearish exposure, potentially signaling a bottoming process or price stabilization, despite a large drop in open interest (-3,992).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4 style="font-size: 10pt;">STEEL-HRC</h4>
        <ul style="font-size: 10pt;">
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong> Nearly neutral net-short at -28 contracts (reduced shorts by +45 WoW). Sentiment is balancing out.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong> Remain net-short at -5,738 contracts but covered some shorts (+252 WoW).</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Positioning suggests a lack of strong directional conviction from speculators. Commercial short covering points to a potential stabilization in prices.</li>
