            <h4>Macro Risk Dashboard</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Economic Slowdown Signals:</strong> Widespread bearish speculative positioning in key industrial metals like Copper (COT Index: 31.25, Z-score: -0.87), Cobalt (COT Index: 24.31, Z-score: -1.33), and Lithium Hydroxide (COT Index: 25.12, Z-score: -1.22) signals concerns over future industrial demand and potential economic weakness. [cite: COPPER- #1, COBALT, LITHIUM HYDROXIDE, 2025-09-23]</li>
                <li><strong>No Market Complacency:</strong> The absence of extreme bullish positioning or exhaustion risk flags in any industrial metal suggests that a broad, sudden market correction due to overextension is unlikely within this sector. [cite: All Industrial Metals, 2025-09-23]</li>
