        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The latest Commitments of Traders (COT) data reveals a generally cautious, if not outright bearish, sentiment across Industrial Metals. Speculative bullishness in Lithium Hydroxide is a clear outlier, approaching extreme levels. Conversely, Copper and Steel HRC saw significant increases in speculative short positions, signaling growing bearish conviction. Aluminium MWP traders, however, show signs of waning bearishness.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong><span> Slightly net long (+38 contracts), shifting from net short WoW by +78 contracts. However, the Managed Money Z-score (-2.13) indicates this small net long is extremely low historically, implying deep underlying bearishness.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong><span> Slightly net long (+38 contracts), with no significant week-over-week change.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong><span> Despite a nominal net long, the extreme historical bearishness among speculators indicates strong underlying downside risk.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
