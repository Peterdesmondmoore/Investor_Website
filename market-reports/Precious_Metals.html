            <h4>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Complacency/Overextension (Gold):</strong> Gold exhibits extreme speculative net-long positioning (COT Index: 90, Z-score: 2.0) with an explicit <code>flag_exhaustion_risk</code> (Source: GOLD, 2025-09-23). This signals a crowded long trade, highly vulnerable to a sharp correction if sentiment shifts or profit-taking ensues. Impact: Could trigger a broad risk-off unwinding, pressuring safe-haven assets.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Slowdown Signals (Palladium):</strong> Palladium shows extreme speculative net-short positioning (COT Index: 10, Z-score: -2.0) and a <code>flag_squeeze_setup</code> (Source: PALLADIUM, 2025-09-23). While ripe for a bounce, this deep bearishness in an industrial metal may reflect persistent concerns about global industrial demand or manufacturing, hinting at underlying economic weakness. Impact: Potential for continued pressure on cyclical commodities despite tactical short covering.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rate/Inflation Risks (Gold):</strong> Gold's extreme bullish stance implies strong market conviction in persistent inflation or heightened safe-haven demand (Source: GOLD, 2025-09-23). Should central bank policy or inflation data surprise to the downside, this crowded long position could unwind violently, suggesting a potential recalibration of market expectations. Impact: Could lead to broader market instability and a re-pricing of risk assets.</li>

            <h4>Key Investment Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrarian (Short Squeeze Potential): Palladium.</strong> Speculators are extremely net-short (COT Index: 10, Z-score: -2.0) with a confirmed <code>flag_squeeze_setup</code> (Source: PALLADIUM, 2025-09-23). Any positive catalyst could ignite a rapid short covering rally.</li>
                <li><strong>Momentum (Trend Continuation): Platinum.</strong> Strong speculative net-long positioning (COT Index: 75, Z-score: 1.5) with increasing net positions (ΔNet: 200) and rising open interest (ΔOI: 78415) suggests robust bullish conviction and further upside (Source: PLATINUM, 2025-09-23).</li>
                <li><strong>Mean Reversion (Long Exhaustion): Gold.</strong> Extreme speculative net-long positioning (COT Index: 90, Z-score: 2.0) and an explicit <code>flag_exhaustion_risk</code> make Gold vulnerable to a sharp pullback from profit-taking (Source: GOLD, 2025-09-23). This offers a tactical shorting opportunity.</li>
                <li><strong>Divergence Play: Gold.</strong> Despite headline long exhaustion risk, Gold exhibits a <code>flag_mm_swap_divergence</code> (Source: GOLD, 2025-09-23). This divergence suggests complex underlying positioning dynamics, hinting at nuanced trade opportunities beyond simple mean reversion.</li>
