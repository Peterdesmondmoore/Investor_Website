    <div class="summary-section">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The latest Commitments of Traders (CoT) data reveals a market characterized by predominantly risk-on sentiment, albeit with significant underlying risks of overextension and complacency. Key themes include: Extreme bullish positioning in Equity Indices, suggesting overextension. Precious metals are heavily favored by speculators, indicating inflation concerns or safe-haven demand. Strong speculative bullishness in Energy and Industrial Metals points to robust growth expectations. Extreme net-short positioning in VIX futures indicates high market complacency.

            <h2>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Complacency/Overextension (Equities):</strong><span> Extreme bullish positioning (COT Index: 95, Z-score: 2.80) observed in S&P 500 FUTURES - CME. Potential Impact: Signals a crowded trade highly vulnerable to sharp corrections or profit-taking. A reversal could trigger significant price declines.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Volatility Complacency:</strong><span> Speculators hold a significant net-long position in VIX Futures (100,000 contracts) with a low COT Index (20). This indicates extreme complacency. Potential Impact: A sudden market shock or an increase in uncertainty could trigger a violent short squeeze in volatility, leading to rapid and amplified market declines across risk assets.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Bond Market Overextension:</strong><span> Strong speculative net-long positioning in 10-YR US TREASURY NOTES - CBT (COT Index: 85, Z-score: 2.10). Potential Impact: This indicates strong market conviction for falling interest rates. A hawkish shift from central banks or persistent inflation data could lead to a sharp bond sell-off and broader market instability.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Precious Metals Overextension:</strong><span> Extreme speculative net-long positions in GOLD - COMEX (COT Index: 90, Z-score: 2.50). Potential Impact: Such high conviction in safe-haven or inflation-hedge assets implies significant risk if inflation eases or risk sentiment improves, leading to a rapid unwind of positions.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Crude Oil Overextension:</strong><span> Extreme bullish positioning (COT Index: 85, Z-score: 2.00) observed in CRUDE OIL. Potential Impact: Signals a crowded trade highly vulnerable to sharp corrections or profit-taking. A reversal could trigger significant price declines.</span></li>
