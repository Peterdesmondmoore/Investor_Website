Several agricultural commodities show clear signs of overextension, signaling potential mean reversion, while industrial and other soft commodities face deep bearishness, indicating economic slowdown concerns or ripe short-squeeze opportunities. Precious metals continue to attract strong bullish interest for inflation hedging. Overall, the environment necessitates cautious navigation, with tactical opportunities emerging from crowded trades.
