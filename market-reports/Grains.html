    <h1>Subject: Weekly State of the Market - All Asset Classes (2025-09-23)</h1>

    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The latest Commitments of Traders (CoT) data reveals a broadly divergent market environment. Key themes include extreme bullishness in Equity Indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ 100), crowded long positions in Precious Metals (Gold, Silver), extreme bearish sentiment in Interest Rate futures (US T-Bonds, Eurodollar), and significant net short VIX positioning. While risk-on sentiment is prevalent in equities and industrial metals, persistent bearishness in bonds and volatility indicates underlying macro concerns and potential for sharp reversals.
