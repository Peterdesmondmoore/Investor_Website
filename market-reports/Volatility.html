            <h4>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Volatility Shocks:</strong> Non-commercials hold a substantial net-short position in VIX futures (198,872 short vs. 97,679 long on 2025-09-23, VIX FUTURES data). This creates significant vulnerability to a sudden market shock, capable of triggering a violent short squeeze in volatility.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Complacency:</strong> The sustained bearish speculative positioning in VIX, indicated by a low COT Index (39.54 on 2025-09-23, VIX FUTURES data), signals widespread market complacency. This leaves the broader market exposed to rapid repricing if unexpected events materialize.</li>

            <h4>Key Investment Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrarian (Long VIX):</strong> The pronounced net-short non-commercial positioning (VIX FUTURES data, 2025-09-23) suggests a crowded trade. Any shift in market sentiment or unexpected event could trigger a powerful short squeeze in VIX, offering a high-conviction long entry for volatility.</li>
                <li><strong>Mean Reversion (Long VIX):</strong> Speculative positioning for lower volatility appears stretched, with negative Z-scores (-0.85 52-week, -1.05 156-week on 2025-09-23, VIX FUTURES data). This indicates a historical deviation, setting up a mean-reversion opportunity for volatility to rise.</li>
