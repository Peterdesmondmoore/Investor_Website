    <h1>Subject: State of the Market - CoT Analysis (Data Unavailable)</h1>

    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
        **Unable to Generate Report: No Commitments of Traders (CoT) Data Provided.**
    </p>
    <p>
        The request for a 'State of the Market' summary based on CoT reports across all asset classes cannot be fulfilled as the provided DataFrame is empty. Without the essential CoT data (e.g., Noncommercial positions, Open Interest, COT Index, Z-scores, and weekly changes), it is impossible to perform a meaningful analysis of market sentiment, identify macro risks, or pinpoint investment opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
        To generate the requested analysis, please provide the complete CoT reports with current speculative positioning data for Equities, Bonds, Currencies, Commodities, and Volatility.
    </p>

    <h2>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h2>
    <p>
        **Analysis Not Possible Due to Missing Data.**
    </p>
    <p>
        Without CoT data on key contracts such as Equity Index futures (S&P 500, Russell 2000), Metals (Copper, Gold), Bonds (US 10-Year, 30-Year), Currency futures (Euro FX, Yen), and VIX futures, it is impossible to assess:
        <ul>
            <li>Market Complacency/Overextension: Cannot identify extreme bullish positioning in risk assets.</li>
            <li>Economic Slowdown Signals: Cannot detect widespread bearish sentiment in cyclical assets.</li>
            <li>Volatility Shocks: Cannot analyze VIX speculative positioning to predict potential shocks.</li>
            <li>Interest Rate/Inflation Risks: Cannot infer market expectations from bond and precious metals positioning.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Key Investment Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
        **Analysis Not Possible Due to Missing Data.**
    </p>
    <p>
        Without the specific speculative positioning data (net-long/net-short positions, changes week-over-week, and historical context like COT Index/Z-scores) for individual futures contracts across various asset classes, it is impossible to identify actionable investment opportunities such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Contrarian (Short Squeeze Potential): Cannot pinpoint assets with extreme net-short positioning.</li>
            <li>Momentum (Trend Continuation): Cannot identify assets with strong and increasing speculative conviction.</li>
            <li>Mean Reversion (Long Exhaustion): Cannot highlight over-extended assets with extreme net-long positioning.</li>
            <li>Divergence Plays: Cannot analyze conflicting signals within asset classes.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
