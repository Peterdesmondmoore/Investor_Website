        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The Commitments of Traders (CoT) report analysis cannot be performed as the provided data is an "Empty DataFrame". Without the actual CoT data for various asset classes, it is impossible to assess current market sentiment, identify macro risks, or pinpoint specific investment opportunities.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlights-grid">
        <div class="highlight-card opportunities">
            <h4>Key Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Opportunities Identified:</strong> Without CoT data, no actionable investment opportunities (Contrarian, Momentum, Mean Reversion, Divergence) can be derived from speculative positioning.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-card risks">
            <h4>Key Risks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Risks Identified:</strong> The absence of CoT data precludes the identification of systemic or broad market risks related to market complacency, economic slowdown signals, volatility shocks, or interest rate/inflation concerns.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h3>
    <p>
        Analysis for top 3-5 systemic risks is currently unavailable due to the lack of CoT data.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Market Complacency/Overextension:</strong> Cannot be assessed without positioning data for Equity Indices or Industrial Metals.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Slowdown Signals:</strong> Impossible to ascertain without sentiment data from cyclical assets like Copper, Corn, or Russell 2000.</li>
        <li><strong>Volatility Shocks:</strong> No assessment of VIX futures positioning can be made to identify short squeeze risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest Rate/Inflation Risks:</strong> Cannot be determined without positioning in sovereign bonds and precious metals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Investment Opportunities</h3>
    <p>
        Actionable investment opportunities cannot be identified without the necessary CoT data.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrarian (Short Squeeze Potential):</strong> Assets like Coffee, Lumber, or Palladium cannot be evaluated for extreme net-short positioning.</li>
        <li><strong>Momentum (Trend Continuation):</strong> No assessment of strong speculative conviction in assets such as Euro FX, Lean Hogs, or Cotton is possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Mean Reversion (Long Exhaustion):</strong> Assets like Gold or Sugar cannot be analyzed for extreme net-long positioning indicating over-extension.</li>
        <li><strong>Divergence Plays:</strong> Conflicting signals within asset classes cannot be identified without data for products like S&P 500 futures and S&P Dividend futures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Asset Class Summaries</h3>
    <p>
        Specific CoT analysis for Equities, Bonds, Currencies, Commodities, and Volatility is not possible due to the absence of input data. Please provide the CoT reports to proceed with a detailed market summary.
