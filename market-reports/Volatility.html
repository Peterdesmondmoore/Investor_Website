    <h1>Subject: State of the Market - CoT Report Analysis (Missing Data)</h1>
    
    <div class="summary-section">
        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            I am unable to provide a 'State of the Market' summary as requested. The Commitments of Traders (CoT) report data provided for analysis is an 'Empty DataFrame' with 0 rows, meaning there is no actual CoT data to process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without the specific CoT positions for non-commercials, commercials, and open interest across the various asset classes (Equities, Bonds, Currencies, Commodities, and Volatility), it is impossible to synthesize market sentiment, identify macro risks, or pinpoint investment opportunities as per the instructions.
        </p>

    <div class="highlights-grid">
        <div class="highlight-card opportunities">
            <h4>Key Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Opportunities Identified:</strong> Due to the absence of data, no actionable investment opportunities can be determined.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-card risks">
            <h4>Key Risks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Deficiency Risk:</strong> The primary risk identified is the lack of underlying data, which prevents any meaningful CoT analysis.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h2>
    <p>
        Analysis for the Macro Risk Dashboard, covering market complacency, economic slowdown signals, volatility shocks, and interest rate/inflation risks, cannot be performed without valid CoT data. Each risk assessment relies fundamentally on interpreting speculative and commercial positioning trends, which are absent from the provided input.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Investment Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
        The identification of contrarian, momentum, mean reversion, or divergence plays is entirely dependent on the specific net-long/short positions, changes in open interest, and historical context (e.g., COT Index, Z-scores). As no data was available, no such opportunities can be identified or categorized.
    </p>

    <h3>Further Action Required</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Please provide the actual Commitments of Traders reports, ensuring they are not empty, for a comprehensive analysis.</li>
    </ul>
