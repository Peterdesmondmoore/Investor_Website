I regret to inform you that the provided Commitments of Traders (CoT) reports appear to be empty. The DataFrame contains "0 rows x 149 columns," indicating no data for analysis.

To generate the requested 'State of the Market' summary, including the Executive Summary, Macro Risk Dashboard, and Key Investment Opportunities, I require the actual CoT data across the specified asset classes (Equities, Bonds, Currencies, Commodities, and Volatility).

Please provide the complete CoT reports, and I will promptly perform the detailed analysis as outlined in your request.
