    <h1>Subject: CoT Analysis Request - Data Missing</h1>
    <p>
        I apologize, but I am unable to generate the 'State of the Market' summary, macro risk dashboard, and investment opportunities as requested.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Commitments of Traders (CoT) data provided in the prompt, specifically the DataFrame, is empty. Without actual CoT report data for analysis across Equities, Bonds, Currencies, Commodities, and Volatility, I cannot synthesize findings, characterize market sentiment, identify systemic risks, or pinpoint specific investment opportunities. Generating the report would require fabricating information rather than analyzing actual reports.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please provide the complete CoT reports or populate the DataFrame with the necessary data, and I will gladly proceed with the detailed analysis, adhering to all specified formatting and content requirements.
    </p>
