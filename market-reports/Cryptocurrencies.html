        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            I am unable to generate the requested 'State of the Market' summary based on Commitments of Traders (CoT) reports. The provided input explicitly states an "Empty DataFrame" with "0 rows x 149 columns", indicating that no CoT data was supplied for analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            To characterize market sentiment, identify macro risks, and pinpoint investment opportunities, detailed CoT positioning data across various asset classes (Equities, Bonds, Currencies, Commodities, and Volatility) is essential. Without this data, a meaningful analysis cannot be performed.

            <h4>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h4>
            <p>
                The identification of systemic risks such as market complacency, economic slowdown signals, volatility shocks, or interest rate/inflation risks relies entirely on the granular analysis of speculative positioning, open interest, and historical CoT metrics. As no CoT report data was provided, these critical risk signals cannot be assessed.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-card opportunities">
            <h4>Key Investment Opportunities</h4>
            <p>
                Specific investment opportunities—whether contrarian (short squeeze potential), momentum (trend continuation), mean reversion (long exhaustion), or divergence plays—are derived directly from the analysis of speculative net positions and their changes. Without the underlying CoT data, these actionable insights cannot be identified or presented.
            </p>

    <h3>Further Action Required</h3>
    <p>
        Please provide the actual Commitments of Traders (CoT) reports containing the necessary data across the specified asset classes. Once the data is attached, I will promptly proceed with the comprehensive 'State of the Market' summary, structured precisely to your requirements for macro risk assessment and investment opportunity identification.
