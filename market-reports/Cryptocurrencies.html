        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>NOTE: This analysis utilizes illustrative content from the provided prompt's example due to an empty CoT data DataFrame. A comprehensive market analysis across all asset classes, with specific citations, is not possible without valid data. This report serves as an illustrative template for a Precious Metals sub-classification analysis.</strong>
            <br>
            The latest Commitments of Traders (COT) data (<em>illustratively within Precious Metals</em>) reveals a bifurcated market sentiment. Gold and Silver remain under significant speculative bullish pressure, reaching extreme positioning levels. Conversely, Platinum and Micro Gold show signs of cooling bullish conviction. Palladium maintains a slight bearish tilt. The overall environment shows divergent conviction.

            <h4>Macro Risk Dashboard (Illustrative)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Complacency/Overextension:</strong> Gold & Silver (as per prompt example) exhibit extreme speculative net-longs (COT Index > 80, Z-score > 1.9), signaling crowded trades vulnerable to sharp corrections.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Slowdown Signals:</strong> (Hypothetically for broader markets) widespread bearish sentiment in cyclical assets (e.g., Copper, Russell 2000 in a real scenario) would indicate a potential economic downturn.</li>
                <li><strong>Volatility Shocks:</strong> (Hypothetically) large speculative net-short VIX futures positions create the risk of a violent short squeeze.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rate/Inflation Risks:</strong> Extreme conviction in assets like Gold (longs) suggests stress or overbought expectations regarding inflation/policy, risking broader instability.</li>

            <h4>Key Investment Opportunities (Illustrative)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mean Reversion (Long Exhaustion):</strong> Gold (as per prompt example) shows extreme speculative net-longs, indicating an overextended position vulnerable to pullbacks, offering a tactical short opportunity.</li>
                <li><strong>Contrarian (Short Squeeze Potential):</strong> Palladium (as per prompt example) illustrates assets with net-short speculative positioning, but with decreasing bearish bets, setting the stage for a short squeeze.</li>
                <li><strong>Momentum (Trend Continuation):</strong> (Hypothetically for broader markets) strong conviction (rising net positions/open interest) in assets like Euro FX or Lean Hogs would suggest trend continuation.</li>
                <li><strong>Divergence Plays:</strong> (Hypothetically for broader markets) conflicting signals between S&P 500 core futures and S&P Dividend futures would present nuanced trading opportunities.</li>

        <h3>Gold</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong><span>Dominantly bullish with a significant net-long position (261,740 contracts), increasing by 12,210 WoW. Positioning is extremely bullish (COT Index: 95.34, Z-score: 2.75).</span></li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong><span>Remain heavily net-short (-273,375 contracts), slightly reducing exposure WoW. They are traditionally counter-trend.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong><span>Strong speculative conviction fuels potential upside, but extreme positioning warns of exhaustion risk.</span></li>
        </ul>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h3>Palladium</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong><span>Although speculators are net short, they are reducing their bearish bets, setting the stage for a potential short squeeze if positive catalysts emerge.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong><span>Would likely be net-long, typically on the opposite side of speculators.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong><span>Potential for a short-covering rally given reduced bearish conviction.</span></li>
