            <h3>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Complacency/Overextension:</strong> ETHANOL (Agricultural Commodities). Extreme speculative net-long (43,181 contracts) with high COT Index (95.12) and Z-Score (2.61). Signals a crowded trade vulnerable to a sharp correction, risking broader risk-off sentiment.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Slowdown Signals:</strong> BUTTER (Agricultural Commodities). Widespread bearish sentiment with extreme net-short positioning (-45,781 contracts), low COT Index (4.88) and Z-Score (-2.57). Bearishness in this cyclical commodity suggests market participants pricing in a downturn, risking broader equity and commodity market weakness.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rate Policy Stress (Long Bonds):</strong> MILK, Class III (Agricultural Commodities). Extreme speculative net-long (23,071 contracts) in MILK (COT Index: 89.25, Z-Score: 2.11).

            <h3>Key Investment Opportunities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BUTTER (Contrarian - Short Squeeze Potential):</strong> Rationale: Extreme net-short (-45,781 contracts, COT Index: 4.88, Z-Score: -2.57) suggests an oversold market ripe for a rapid price rally if sentiment shifts.</li>
