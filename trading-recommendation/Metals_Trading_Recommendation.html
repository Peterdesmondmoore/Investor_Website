However, the neutral signal <cite>Signal: 0</cite> prevents a high conviction classification, suggesting a need for confirmation or a tactical entry point.</p>

            <p>COPA presents a highly unreliable scenario for trading, despite a bullish signal <cite>Signal: 1</cite> and price breaking 24-hour resistance <cite>Res_24H: 33.9298, Break_Up_24H: True</cite> with strong ADX <cite>ADX_14H: 36.2001</cite>. The primary and critical issue is the reported volume of 0 <cite>Volume: 0</cite>. This indicates that the quoted close price <cite>Close: 34.7165</cite> may not be representative of actual trading activity, rendering all other bullish technical indicators (such as MACD histogram <cite>MACD_Hist: 0.0153</cite> and high RSI <cite>RSI_14H: 71.3549</cite>) highly questionable and untrustworthy for an executable trade plan.</p>
