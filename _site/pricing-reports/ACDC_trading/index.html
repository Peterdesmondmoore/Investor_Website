    <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument is currently exhibiting a <strong>clear bearish trend</strong> across short-to-medium timeframes, with price trading significantly below all key moving averages. Momentum is negative, and directional movement indicators confirm bearish control, though the overall trend strength is currently weak. The latest hourly data shows continued downward pressure, pushing the price towards significant support.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="observations">
        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dominant Bearish Trend:</strong> The current Close price (<span class="data-point">3.620</span>) is trading below all short-term (SMA_20H: <span class="data-point">3.67293</span>, EMA_20H: <span class="data-point">3.708227</span>) and medium-term (SMA_50H: <span class="data-point">3.727014</span>, EMA_50H: <span class="data-point">3.731877</span>) moving averages, indicating consistent downward pressure. It is also significantly below the long-term EMA_200H (<span class="data-point">4.259336</span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Negative Price Action:</strong> The Hourly Return is negative (<span class="data-point">-0.016304</span>), and the Close (<span class="data-point">3.620</span>) is below the daily VWAP (<span class="data-point">3.784245</span>), signaling strong intraday selling pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Bearish Directional Bias:</strong> While the ADX_14H (<span class="data-point">13.628270</span>) indicates a weak overall trend, the DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">26.320218</span>) is notably higher than DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">23.431415</span>), confirming a bearish directional bias.</li>
            <li><strong>Weakening Momentum:</strong> The RSI_14H at <span class="data-point">44.019032</span> is below the neutral 50-level, suggesting bearish momentum. MACD (<span class="data-point">0.001508</span>) is barely above its signal line (<span class="data-point">-0.001326</span>) with a very small positive MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">0.002834</span>), indicating a loss of bullish momentum and potential for a bearish cross.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity to Support:</strong> The price is approaching the 24H Support level (<span class="data-point">3.54</span>), suggesting this could be the next key level to watch for potential consolidation or a breakdown.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintain Bearish Stance:</strong> Given the overwhelming bearish indicators, traders should maintain a bearish bias. Short positions are favored, or existing long positions should be carefully re-evaluated for exit.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor Support:</strong> Watch for a decisive break below the 24H Support level (<span class="data-point">3.54</span>). A breach of this level could accelerate downside movement, presenting further shorting opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Long Entries:</strong> Initiating new long positions is highly speculative and carries significant risk given the clear downtrend and negative momentum.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> While the trend is bearish, the weak ADX suggests that volatility might be low, but downside risks remain considerable.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="signal-breakdown">
        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: -1 (Sell)</strong></p>
            <p>
                This summary signal indicates a strong bearish bias for the instrument. It suggests that the aggregated technical indicators are predominantly aligned to favor a short position or exiting long positions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            For the latest hourly snapshot, all specific boolean flags such as <code>Break_Up_24H</code>, <code>Vol_Spike</code>, <code>Bull_Engulfing_H</code>, etc., are <strong>False</strong>. This signifies that in this <em>specific</em> hour, there were no new explicit breakout events, significant volume spikes, or specific reversal candlestick patterns. The 'Sell' signal is therefore driven by the broader, consistent bearish trend confirmed by moving averages, negative price action, and momentum indicators rather than an isolated event.
