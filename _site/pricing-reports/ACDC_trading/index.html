    <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument is currently in a <strong>strong bearish trend</strong> across all timeframes. Momentum is decisively negative, and selling pressure remains dominant, indicating further downside potential. While the trend strength itself appears weak, bears maintain control.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="observations">
        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decisive Bearish Trend:</strong> The current Close price (<span class="data-point">3.620</span>) is trading below all key moving averages: SMA_20H (<span class="data-point">3.673</span>), EMA_20H (<span class="data-point">3.708</span>), SMA_50H (<span class="data-point">3.727</span>), EMA_50H (<span class="data-point">3.732</span>), and significantly below EMA_200H (<span class="data-point">4.259</span>). This confirms a robust downtrend across short, medium, and long-term horizons.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative Momentum Dominance:</strong> The RSI_14H at <span class="data-point">44.019</span> is below the neutral 50 level, indicating bearish momentum. The MACD (<span class="data-point">0.0015</span>) is barely positive, while its Signal line (<span class="data-point">-0.0013</span>) is negative, with MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">0.0028</span>) sharply declining from previous hours, signaling weakening bullish momentum and imminent bearish crossover or continued divergence.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent Selling Pressure:</strong> The current Close (<span class="data-point">3.620</span>) is well below the daily VWAP (<span class="data-point">3.798</span>), reflecting strong intraday selling pressure and a bearish sentiment throughout the trading day.</li>
            <li><strong>Bearish Directional Bias:</strong> Although the ADX_14H at <span class="data-point">13.628</span> suggests a relatively weak trend, DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">26.320</span>) is higher than DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">23.431</span>), confirming that bears are in control of the price direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Significant Hourly Decline:</strong> The instrument recorded a negative hourly return of <span class="data-point">-1.63%</span> (<span class="data-point">-0.016304</span>).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Short Positions:</strong> Given the pervasive bearish indicators, traders should focus on maintaining or initiating short positions. Potential resistance levels at SMA_20H (<span class="data-point">3.673</span>) or EMA_20H (<span class="data-point">3.708</span>) could offer favorable entry points for new shorts or adding to existing ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Target:</strong> The 24H Support level at <span class="data-point">3.54</span> serves as a primary downside target. A break below this level would likely accelerate the downtrend.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Long Positions:</strong> There are no technical justifications for long positions at this time. Attempting to "catch the falling knife" is not advised.</li>
            <li><strong>Trend Strength Monitor:</strong> The low ADX_14H (<span class="data-point">13.628</span>) indicates the current downtrend lacks strong conviction. Watch for a potential increase in ADX, which would signal a strengthening of the existing bearish trend, or a significant rise in DI+ to indicate a reversal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: -1 (Sell)</strong></p>
            <p>
                The summary Signal value of <span class="data-point">-1</span> indicates a strong bearish bias. This suggests that the majority of aggregated technical indicators are aligned to favor a short position.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            For the latest hourly snapshot, all specific boolean flags such as <code>Break_Up_24H</code>, <code>Break_Down_24H</code>, <code>Vol_Breakout_Up</code>, <code>Vol_Breakout_Down</code>, <code>Vol_Spike</code>, <code>Bull_Engulfing_H</code>, <code>Hammer_H</code>, <code>Gap_Up_H</code>, and <code>Gap_Down_H</code> are all marked as <strong>False</strong>. This means that in this specific hour, no fresh breakout events, significant volume spikes, or key candlestick reversal patterns were identified. However, the continuous decline in price and consistently bearish indicators underscore the overall negative sentiment.
