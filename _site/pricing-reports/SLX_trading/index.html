        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument is displaying a <strong>neutral to slightly bearish bias</strong> in the short-to-medium term. Price is currently below key moving averages and momentum indicators suggest downside pressure. However, the latest hourly close is holding at a critical 24-hour support level, marked by a significant volume spike and a positive hourly return, hinting at a potential short-term bounce.

    <section id="observations">
        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Short-Term Bearish Trend:</strong> The current Close price (<span class="data-point">71.860001</span>) is below the SMA_20H (<span class="data-point">72.115165</span>), SMA_50H (<span class="data-point">72.232515</span>), EMA_20H (<span class="data-point">72.106300</span>), and EMA_50H (<span class="data-point">72.057424</span>), indicating a downtrend across shorter timeframes.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Bullish Foundation:</strong> Price (<span class="data-point">71.860001</span>) is sustained above the long-term EMA_200H (<span class="data-point">70.924930</span>), providing a bullish underpinning to the broader trend.</li>
            <li><strong>Bearish Momentum Confirmed:</strong> The MACD (<span class="data-point">-0.091872</span>) is below its Signal line (<span class="data-point">-0.059849</span>) with a negative MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">-0.032022</span>), confirming current bearish momentum. The RSI_14H (<span class="data-point">43.998564</span>) below 50 indicates weakening buying strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Critical Support Level:</strong> The current Close (<span class="data-point">71.860001</span>) is positioned just above the 24H Support (<span class="data-point">71.750000</span>), suggesting this level is currently being defended.</li>
            <li><strong>Intraday Selling Pressure:</strong> The Close (<span class="data-point">71.860001</span>) is below the daily VWAP (<span class="data-point">72.058722</span>), reflecting intraday selling dominance.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Activity at Support:</strong> A Vol_Spike (<span class="data-point">True</span>) is noted with current Volume (<span class="data-point">3294</span>) significantly exceeding Avg_Vol_24H (<span class="data-point">1914.666667</span>), indicating heightened trading activity around the support level.</li>
            <li><strong>Weak Overall Trend:</strong> The ADX_14H (<span class="data-point">14.576648</span>) is below 20, signifying a weak or non-trending market environment, despite DI+ (<span class="data-point">33.522162</span>) being slightly above DI- (<span class="data-point">32.667483</span>).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Support Test:</strong> Traders must closely monitor the 24H Support level (<span class="data-point">71.750000</span>). A sustained break below this level could lead to further downside, potentially targeting the EMA_200H (<span class="data-point">70.924930</span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Reversal Potential:</strong> The Vol_Spike (<span class="data-point">True</span>) at support, coupled with a positive hourly return (<span class="data-point">0.001533</span>), suggests potential for a short-term bounce. For a bullish reversal to materialize, the instrument must reclaim short-term moving averages (e.g., EMA_20H at <span class="data-point">72.106300</span>) and show renewed momentum.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirmation Needed:</strong> Given the weak trend (ADX_14H <span class="data-point">14.576648</span>) and conflicting signals (short-term bearish, long-term bullish), traders should wait for clearer directional confirmation before committing to significant positions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: 0 (Neutral)</strong></p>
            <p>
                The summary Signal value of <span class="data-point">0</span> indicates a Neutral stance. The aggregated technical indicators are not providing a clear, strong directional bias (neither decisively bullish nor bearish) at this specific hourly snapshot.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            For the latest hourly snapshot (2025-09-23 19:30), the <code>Vol_Spike</code> flag is <strong>True</strong>. This means the current hourly Volume (<span class="data-point">3294</span>) is significantly higher than the average volume over the last 24 hours (<span class="data-point">1914.666667</span>), indicating heightened trading activity. All other boolean flags (e.g., <code>Break_Up_24H</code>, <code>Break_Down_24H</code>, <code>Bull_Engulfing_H</code>) are <strong>False</strong> for this hour, suggesting no other immediate pattern or breakout event has been confirmed by the system in this latest candle.
