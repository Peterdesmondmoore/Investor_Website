        Pricing Report - Hourly financial data for the instrument. Latest snapshot (<span class="data-point">2025-09-22 10:00:00+00:00</span>):
    </p>

    <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument is exhibiting a <strong>strong bullish trend</strong> across all timeframes, supported by robust momentum and directional strength. A confirmed upward breakout, backed by significant volume, has occurred in the latest hour. However, the price is heavily overbought and nearing the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting potential for short-term consolidation before further upside.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="observations">
        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strong Bullish Trend:</strong> The Close (<span class="data-point">3092.0</span>) is significantly above all moving averages (SMA_20H: <span class="data-point">2987.56</span>, SMA_50H: <span class="data-point">2966.10</span>, EMA_20H: <span class="data-point">3007.36</span>, EMA_50H: <span class="data-point">2970.51</span>, EMA_200H: <span class="data-point">2877.09</span>), confirming a robust uptrend across all timeframes.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust Momentum:</strong> MACD (<span class="data-point">36.54</span>) is well above its signal line (<span class="data-point">22.70</span>) with a strong positive MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">13.84</span>), indicating strong and sustained bullish momentum.</li>
            <li><strong>Dominant Uptrend Strength:</strong> The ADX_14H at <span class="data-point">33.85</span> signals a very strong trending market, with DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">48.26</span>) considerably higher than DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">11.77</span>), confirming bullish directional strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirmed Upward Breakout:</strong> `Break_Up_24H` is `True`, with the Close (<span class="data-point">3092.0</span>) breaking decisively above the 24H Resistance (<span class="data-point">3087.0</span>). This breakout is further validated by `Vol_Breakout_Up` being `True` and a `Vol_Spike` (`384788` vs Avg_Vol_24H: <span class="data-point">74312.08</span>), indicating strong buying conviction.</li>
            <li><strong>Overbought Conditions:</strong> The RSI_14H at <span class="data-point">81.64</span> is deep within the overbought region (>70), suggesting an extended move that might precede a short-term pullback or consolidation. The price is also nearing the upper Bollinger Band (BB_Up_20H: <span class="data-point">3102.39</span>).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Long Positions:</strong> While the instrument is in a powerful uptrend with confirmed breakouts, new aggressive entries at current overbought levels carry increased risk. Consider awaiting a shallow pullback towards the newly established support at the former 24H Resistance (around <span class="data-point">3087.0</span>) or the EMA_20H (around <span class="data-point">3007.36</span>) for better risk-reward entry points.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Monitoring:</strong> The broken 24H Resistance (<span class="data-point">3087.0</span>) is now immediate support. A successful hold above this level reinforces the bullish outlook.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Despite the strong trend, the extreme overbought RSI warrants careful monitoring for signs of exhaustion. Implement appropriate stop-losses to protect against unexpected pullbacks.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="signal-breakdown">
        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: 1 (Buy)</strong></p>
            <p>
                This summary signal indicates a strong bullish bias for the instrument. It unequivocally suggests that the aggregated technical indicators are predominantly aligned to favor a long position.
            </p>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><code>Vol_Spike</code> (`True`): The current hourly volume (<span class="data-point">384788</span>) is exceptionally high compared to the average 24-hour volume (<span class="data-point">74312.08</span>), signifying strong conviction behind the price movement.</li>
            <li><code>Break_Up_24H</code> (`True`): The instrument has decisively broken above its 24-hour resistance level (<span class="data-point">3087.0</span>), signaling a continuation of the upward trend.</li>
            <li><code>Vol_Breakout_Up</code> (`True`): This confirms that the upward price breakout was supported by strong volume, adding reliability to the breakout signal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
