        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Long Positions:</strong> Given the strong bullish signal and recent rally, traders could consider initiating or adding to long positions. A retest of key moving averages like the EMA_20H (approx. <span class="data-point">167.10</span>) or SMA_20H (approx. <span class="data-point">167.57</span>) might offer a more conservative entry point. [Signal Breakdown]</li>
            <li><strong>Momentum Divergence:</strong> Despite the positive price action, the bearish MACD (<span class="data-point">-0.098</span> vs MACD_Signal <span class="data-point">0.267</span>) suggests internal weakness. Monitor MACD for a bullish crossover for stronger confirmation of sustained upside. [Momentum Indicators]</li>
            <li><strong>Volume Confirmation:</strong> The Vol_Spike (True) confirms strong interest, suggesting the current move has conviction. Watch for follow-through volume in subsequent hours. [Volume-based Indicators]</li>
            <li><strong>RSI Check:</strong> While not yet overbought, RSI_14H at <span class="data-point">52.29</span> is elevated. A push above 70 could precede a short-term pullback. [Momentum Indicators]</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Despite the overall bullish context, the bearish MACD suggests potential for a near-term retracement. Set appropriate stop-loss orders. [Momentum Indicators]</li>
