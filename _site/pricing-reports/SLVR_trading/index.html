    <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument is currently in an <strong>extremely strong bullish trend</strong>, exhibiting robust momentum and exceptional directional strength across all timeframes. It has recently broken above its 24-hour resistance, signaling a continuation of the upward movement. However, the price is deeply in overbought territory, suggesting increased risk of a short-term pullback or consolidation, despite the sustained upward pressure.

    <section id="observations">
        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overwhelming Bullish Trend:</strong> The current Close (<span class="data-point">42.81</span>) is trading significantly above all short-term (SMA_20H: <span class="data-point">39.59</span>, EMA_20H: <span class="data-point">40.40</span>), medium-term (SMA_50H: <span class="data-point">38.99</span>, EMA_50H: <span class="data-point">39.06</span>), and long-term (EMA_200H: <span class="data-point">36.19</span>) moving averages, confirming a powerful uptrend.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust Momentum:</strong> MACD (<span class="data-point">1.25</span>) is strongly above its MACD_Signal (<span class="data-point">0.84</span>) with a significant positive MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">0.41</span>), indicating sustained bullish momentum.</li>
            <li><strong>Exceptional Directional Strength:</strong> The ADX_14H at <span class="data-point">42.11</span> confirms a very strong trending market, with DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">54.24</span>) dramatically overshadowing DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">10.52</span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Recent Resistance Breakout:</strong> The Close (<span class="data-point">42.81</span>) is now above the 24H Resistance level (<span class="data-point">42.67</span>), indicating a confirmed bullish breakout (Break_Up_24H: <span class="data-point">True</span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Strong Intraday Buying:</strong> The current Close (<span class="data-point">42.81</span>) is well above the daily VWAP (<span class="data-point">42.00</span>), showcasing consistent buying pressure throughout the day.</li>
            <li><strong>Extreme Overbought Conditions:</strong> The RSI_14H at <span class="data-point">84.42</span> is deep in the overbought region, signaling that the price may be stretched and vulnerable to a correction.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Long Positions:</strong> While the trend is overwhelmingly bullish, the extreme overbought RSI warrants caution. Traders should consider securing partial profits or tightening stop-losses. New long entries are advisable only on significant pullbacks to established support levels, such as EMA_20H (approx. <span class="data-point">40.40</span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance Turned Support:</strong> The previously broken 24H Resistance (<span class="data-point">42.67</span>) now acts as an immediate support. A clear hold above this level would reinforce the bullish conviction.</li>
            <li><strong>Volatility Management:</strong> The high BB_Width (<span class="data-point">0.217725</span>) and ATR_14H (<span class="data-point">0.484491</span>) suggest significant price swings are expected. Adjust position sizing and stop-loss levels accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>No Fresh Impulse:</strong> The absence of a Vol_Spike (<span class="data-point">False</span>) in the latest hour indicates the current bullish move is an extension rather than a new surge of buying interest.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="signal-breakdown">
        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: <span class="data-point">1</span> (Buy)</strong></p>
            <p>
                This summary signal indicates a strong bullish bias for the instrument. It suggests that the aggregated technical indicators are predominantly aligned to favor a long position.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            The boolean flag <code>Break_Up_24H</code> is <strong>True</strong>, confirming that the price has effectively broken above its 24-hour resistance level. All other significant boolean flags, including <code>Vol_Spike</code> (<span class="data-point">False</span>), <code>Vol_Breakout_Up</code> (<span class="data-point">False</span>), <code>Bull_Engulfing_H</code> (<span class="data-point">False</span>), <code>Hammer_H</code> (<span class="data-point">False</span>), <code>Gap_Up_H</code> (<span class="data-point">False</span>), <code>Gap_Down_H</code> (<span class="data-point">False</span>), <code>Break_Down_24H</code> (<span class="data-point">False</span>), and <code>Vol_Breakout_Down</code> (<span class="data-point">False</span>), are <strong>False</strong>. This implies that while a significant bullish breakout has occurred, the latest hour itself did not feature a fresh volume surge or specific candlestick reversal/continuation patterns, suggesting the uptrend is currently established and extending.
