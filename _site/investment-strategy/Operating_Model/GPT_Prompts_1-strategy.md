### ROLE

### OBJECTIVE
Conduct a deep research reassessment of an existing investment strategy, or produce a revised strategy where required, using a standards-based analytical framework.

  - Demand indicators
  - Supply indicators
  - Scenario definitions and probabilities
  - Return and volatility assumptions
- As-of date (default: current date)

### TASKS
1. Assess whether the existing macro, demand, and supply assumptions remain valid.
2. Evaluate recent price and valuation movements relative to original baseline assumptions.
3. Re-evaluate the scenario framework (minimum: Bear / Neutral / Bull):
   - Validate assumptions
   - Adjust scenario probabilities where required
   - Identify regime shifts or path dependency changes
4. Reassess return expectations and performance modelling from current price or valuation levels.
5. Determine the required level of strategy change:
   - No change
   - Minor revision
   - Material revision
   - Full strategy rebuild
6. Identify implications for portfolio construction, deployment, and risk management.
