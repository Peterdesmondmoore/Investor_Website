        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The latest Commitments of Traders (COT) data for Livestock reveals a highly bullish speculative environment, particularly in Lean Hogs. While Feeder Cattle maintains strong speculative conviction, Live Cattle shows early signs of softening bullish momentum. Commercial hedgers across the board are reducing their significant net-short exposure.

        <div class="highlight-card opportunities">
            <h4>Key Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lean Hogs Upside Momentum:</strong> Extreme and significantly increasing speculative net-long positions indicate robust bullish conviction, likely fueling continued price appreciation. Commercial short-covering further supports this.</li>
                <li><strong>Feeder Cattle Sustained Bullishness:</strong> Speculators maintain a high net-long position, supported by a notable reduction in commercial net-shorts. This setup points to underlying market strength.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-card risks">
            <h4>Key Risks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lean Hogs Overextension:</strong> The highly extreme speculative net-long positioning (Z-score: 3.14) signals a crowded trade, highly vulnerable to sharp corrections on any adverse news or profit-taking.</li>
                <li><strong>Live Cattle Waning Conviction:</strong> A week-over-week reduction in speculative net-longs, from an already high base, suggests diminishing bullish enthusiasm. This could precede a price pullback.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Asset Class Summaries</h3>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4>Feeder Cattle</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong> Dominantly bullish with a significant net-long position of 25,412 contracts. Net longs slightly increased (+102 contracts) WoW, driven by short covering. Positioning remains highly bullish (Z-score: 1.96).</li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong> Remain heavily net-short (-9,743 contracts), but actively reduced their net-short exposure by 1,475 contracts WoW. They are typically counter-trend.</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Strong speculative conviction persists, but the modest increase in net longs contrasts with extreme commercial hedging.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4>Lean Hogs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong> Extremely bullish with a substantial net-long position of 140,301 contracts, increasing significantly by 9,198 contracts WoW. Positioning is at historical extremes (Z-score: 3.14).</li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong> Heavily net-short (-13,877 contracts), but reduced their net-short exposure by 4,978 contracts WoW.</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Aggressive speculative buying signals strong potential for further upside, but extreme positioning warns of significant reversal risk.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4>Live Cattle</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong> Highly bullish with a net-long position of 123,750 contracts, but notably decreased (-3,522 contracts) WoW. Positioning remains elevated (Z-score: 2.45).</li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong> Heavily net-short (-124,648 contracts), though they reduced their net-short exposure by 2,905 contracts WoW.</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Speculative conviction is high but softening. A continued reduction in net longs could signal a short-term top.</li>
