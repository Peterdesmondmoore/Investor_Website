        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The latest Commitments of Traders (COT) data for Livestock indicates a predominant bullish sentiment among speculators, particularly notable in Feeder Cattle and Live Cattle. While speculative interest is increasing across the board, commercial hedgers exhibit nuanced positioning, creating specific opportunities and risks for the upcoming week.

    <div class="highlights-grid">
        <div class="highlight-card opportunities">
            <h4>Key Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Feeder Cattle Bullish Breakout:</strong> Speculators are aggressively increasing net-long positions, while commercials are simultaneously reducing their net-short exposure. This alignment signals strong potential for further upward price movement with diminishing hedging resistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Live Cattle Continued Momentum:</strong> Speculative net-longs are expanding, coupled with commercials reducing their bearish hedges. This supportive environment suggests sustained bullish price action for the near term.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-card risks">
            <h4>Key Risks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lean Hogs Hedging Resistance:</strong> Despite growing speculative long interest, commercial hedgers are actively increasing their net-short positioning. This divergence indicates potential price resistance and a cap on rallies as hedgers anticipate future price declines.</li>
