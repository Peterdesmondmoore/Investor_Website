        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The latest Commitments of Traders (COT) data for Industrial Metals reveals a bifurcated market. Speculative sentiment is strongly bullish and increasing for Copper, reaching extreme levels. Aluminum MWP saw a significant bullish shift. Conversely, Aluminum remains in extreme speculative bearish territory. Steel-HRC and Cobalt indicate sustained bearishness, with commercials generally holding counter-trend positions. This setup presents both compelling opportunities and notable risks for the upcoming week.

            <h4>Key Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Copper Sustained Momentum:</strong> Significant increase in net-longs from speculators, already at strong bullish extremes. This signals potential for continued upward price momentum, driven by high conviction.</li>
                <li><strong>ALUMINUM MWP Bullish Reversal:</strong> A substantial shift to net-long positions by speculators indicates a potential trend reversal or strengthening upward movement, offering an entry opportunity.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-card risks">
            <h4>Key Risks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ALUMINUM Extreme Bearishness:</strong> Speculative net-short positioning remains at extreme levels. While suggesting downside, this creates high potential for a sharp short squeeze if any positive catalyst emerges.</li>
                <li><strong>Copper & Lithium Overextension:</strong> Highly concentrated speculative long positions in Copper and Lithium Hydroxide (both with strong bullish Z-scores) imply a significant risk of correction from profit-taking or minor negative news.</li>
            </ul>
