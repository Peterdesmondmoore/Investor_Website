        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The latest Commitments of Traders (COT) data for Precious Metals reveals a bifurcated sentiment. Gold and Silver remain under extreme speculative bullish pressure, reaching levels indicative of potential exhaustion. Conversely, Platinum and Micro Gold show diminishing bullish conviction among speculators. Palladium continues to see speculators reduce their bearish bets.

            <h4>Key Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gold & Silver Sustained Momentum:</strong> Extreme net-longs imply strong, albeit potentially unsustainable, speculative conviction that could drive short-term upside.</li>
                <li><strong>Palladium Short Covering:</strong> Speculators are reducing net-short positions, setting the stage for a potential short squeeze if a positive catalyst emerges.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-card risks">
            <h4>Key Risks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gold & Silver Exhaustion:</strong> Speculative long positions are at or near historical extremes (COT Index > 90, Z-score > 2.5), posing a significant risk of a sharp correction on profit-taking or sentiment shifts.</li>
                <li><strong>Platinum & Micro Gold Weakness:</strong> Decreasing speculative net-longs signal waning bullish conviction, risking further price declines as buying support diminishes.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Asset Class Summaries</h3>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4>Gold</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong><span>Dominantly bullish with an extreme net-long position (261,740 contracts), increasing significantly by 12,210 WoW. Positioning is near historical extremes (COT Index: 95.34, Z-score: 2.75).</span></li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong><span>Remain heavily net-short (-265,691 contracts), indicating a traditional hedging stance against further price increases.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong><span>Strong speculative conviction fuels potential upside, but extreme positioning flags significant exhaustion and reversal risk.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4>Silver</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong><span>Extremely bullish with a substantial net-long position (70,002 contracts), increasing by 2,012 WoW. Positioning is very bullish (COT Index: 92.15, Z-score: 2.55).</span></li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong><span>Heavily net-short (-27,925 contracts), maintaining their typical counter-trend hedging.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong><span>Strong speculative momentum suggests continued upward pressure, but the extreme net-long positioning presents a high risk of sharp correction.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4>Platinum</h4>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong><span>Substantially net-short (-19,402 contracts), maintaining a bearish hedging interest.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong><span>Weakening speculative bullishness suggests potential for price consolidation or a downturn as conviction erodes.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4>Palladium</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong><span>Net-short (-1,523 contracts), but reducing their bearish bets by 197 contracts WoW. Positioning is neutral-to-bearish (COT Index: 29.50, Z-score: -0.85).</span></li>
            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong><span>Net-long (1,137 contracts), indicating a bullish hedging interest.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong><span>Short covering by speculators could provide a floor for prices, and a positive catalyst could trigger a short squeeze.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4>Micro Gold</h4>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Commercials:</strong><span>Net zero (0 contracts), suggesting limited commercial hedging in this market.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong><span>Decreasing speculative net-longs, despite high overall positioning, points to diminishing conviction and increased risk of a pullback.</span></li>
