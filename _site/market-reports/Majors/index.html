        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Based solely on the provided Commitments of Traders (CoT) data for major currencies as of 2025-10-07, market sentiment is highly divergent. Extreme bullish speculative conviction dominates in certain high-yielding or dovish-policy-favored currencies, notably the Mexican Peso, Brazilian Real, and Euro Short Term Rate. Conversely, significant bearish positioning persists in cyclically sensitive and traditional safe-haven currencies, including the Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, and Swiss Franc. This indicates a 'risk-on, but selective' environment, driven by distinct monetary policy expectations and carry trade dynamics. A comprehensive all-asset-class view cannot be provided due to data limitations.

            <h4>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monetary Policy Overextension (EURO SHORT TERM RATE):</strong> Extreme net-long positioning (COT Index 100.00, z-score 2.88) signals aggressive market expectations for dovish ECB policy or rate cuts [df_combined_clean_final, row 12]. Any deviation from this highly concentrated conviction could trigger significant interest rate market instability and broader FX volatility.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyclical Currency Weakness (CAD, AUD, NZD):</strong> Persistent deep net-short positions in <strong>Canadian Dollar</strong> (COT Index 13.69, z-score -2.04), <strong>Australian Dollar</strong> (COT Index 16.04, z-score -1.53), and <strong>NZ Dollar</strong> (COT Index 16.08, z-score -1.35) [df_combined_clean_final, rows 4, 3, 1] indicate widespread global growth concerns. This collective bearishness acts as an early warning for potential economic slowdowns impacting risk assets.</li>
                <li><strong>Emerging Market Carry Trade Crowding (MXN, BRL):</strong> Highly concentrated long positions in <strong>Mexican Peso</strong> (COT Index 83.79, z-score 2.69) and <strong>Brazilian Real</strong> (COT Index 90.66, z-score 2.47) [df_combined_clean_final, rows 6, 0] reflect a crowded carry trade. This renders them highly vulnerable to sudden unwinding amidst risk-off shifts, risking broader EM contagion.</li>

            <h4>Key Investment Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrarian (Short Squeeze) - Canadian Dollar:</strong> Extreme net-short speculative positioning (**COT Index 13.69, z-score -2.04**) [df_combined_clean_final, row 4] sets up a strong short-squeeze candidate. A rebound in global growth sentiment or positive CAD-specific data could trigger a rapid rally, offering a tactical long opportunity.</li>
                <li><strong>Momentum (Trend Continuation) - Japanese Yen:</strong> Strong and increasing net-long positioning (**COT Index 67.74, z-score 1.09**, with "Bullish bias: specs & OI rising") [df_combined_clean_final, row 11] indicates robust conviction for continued JPY appreciation. This suggests the upward trend, likely driven by defensive flows or policy shifts, retains significant momentum.</li>
                <li><strong>Mean Reversion (Long Exhaustion) - Mexican Peso:</strong> Speculative net-longs are highly extended (**COT Index 83.79, z-score 2.69**, with "Bullish bias: specs & OI rising") [df_combined_clean_final, row 6]. This crowded trade is highly vulnerable to profit-taking or sentiment shifts, presenting a compelling tactical shorting opportunity for a sharp pullback.</li>
