        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
            The latest Commitments of Traders (COT) data reveals a nuanced sentiment across major currency markets this week. While the Brazilian Real demonstrates extreme speculative bullishness, several G10 currencies are experiencing either a notable unwinding of long positions or significant short-covering, suggesting a potential shift in underlying momentum.

            <h4>Key Opportunities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brazilian Real (BRL) - Bullish Momentum:</strong> Speculative net-longs are at extreme levels (COT Index 85.33, Z-score 2.79) and continue to rise, indicating strong conviction and potential for further upside.</li>
                <li><strong>British Pound (GBP) - Short Covering:</strong> A substantial reduction of 27,025 contracts in speculative net-short positions points to potential for continued short-covering and a price rebound.</li>
                <li><strong>Swiss Franc (CHF) - Squeeze Setup:</strong> Heavily net-short positioning with initial short-covering and falling open interest creates conditions ripe for a sharp short squeeze.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="highlight-card risks">
            <h4>Key Risks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brazilian Real (BRL) - Overextension:</strong> Extreme net-long positioning presents significant exhaustion risk; aggressive profit-taking could trigger a sharp correction.</li>
                <li><strong>Japanese Yen (JPY) - Fading Conviction:</strong> A massive reduction in speculative net-longs (-30,232 contracts) signals eroding bullish support and increased downside vulnerability.</li>
                <li><strong>EURO FX (EUR) - Softening Momentum:</strong> A notable decrease in speculative net-longs and open interest suggests a potential pause or reversal in its upward trend.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>Commercial (Hedger):</strong> Heavily net-short, consistent with their role of hedging against prevailing market sentiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Strong momentum persists, but extreme positioning warns of significant exhaustion risk.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h4>Japanese Yen (JPY)</h4>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Commercial (Hedger):</strong> Net-short, absorbing the rapid unwinding of speculative long positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Bullish conviction is rapidly eroding, implying potential for continued downside pressure.</li>

            <li><strong>Commercial (Hedger):</strong> Net-short, reflecting hedging against softening speculative long exposure.</li>

        <h4>British Pound (GBP)</h4>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Commercial (Hedger):</strong> Net-long, aligning with their hedging activity against reduced speculative shorts.</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Strong short-covering suggests a potential bottom or reversal, but sustained buying is required for a lasting uptrend.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Mexican Peso (MXN)</h4>
        <ul>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="asset-card">
        <h4>Swiss Franc (CHF)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speculators:</strong> Heavily net-short (-26,040 contracts), but reduced exposure by 2,799 WoW amidst falling open interest. The 'squeeze setup' flag is active.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercial (Hedger):</strong> Net-long, indicating a counter-position to persistent speculative shorts.</li>
            <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Signs of short-covering amid extreme bearish positioning; a short squeeze scenario is plausible.</li>
