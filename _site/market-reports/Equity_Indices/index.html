    <div class="summary-section">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The Commitments of Traders (CoT) data reveals a market characterized by extreme divergence and high conviction in specific sectors. While precious metals, industrial metals, and several agricultural commodities show significant speculative bullish overextension, core equity indices and other key cyclicals are experiencing deep bearish sentiment. This bifurcated positioning highlights areas of potential mean reversion, alongside systemic risks arising from crowded trades and significant interest rate market dislocations. The overall environment suggests a fragile equilibrium, susceptible to sharp reversals.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Macro Risk Dashboard (Early Warning System)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Market Complacency/Overextension:</strong> Extreme bullish positioning in Gold (COT Index: 95.34, Z-score: 2.75) [Source: row 17] and Silver (COT Index: 97.46, Z-score: 3.03) [Source: row 18], along with Copper (COT Index: 80.99, Z-score: 1.63) [Source: row 19], indicates crowded long trades. A sudden sentiment shift or profit-taking could trigger sharp corrections across these key risk assets, potentially leading to a broader unwind in commodity markets.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Economic Slowdown Signals:</strong> Widespread bearish sentiment is evident in the Russell E-Mini (Net Short: -51985, COT Index: 34.00) [Source: row 4] and E-Mini S&P 500 (Net Short: -172549, COT Index: 37.99) [Source: row 1]. This is compounded by extreme net-short positions in cyclical commodities like Corn (COT Index: 1.14, Z-score: -2.71) [Source: row 22] and Soybeans (COT Index: 10.42, Z-score: -1.82) [Source: row 24]. This deepening bearishness in small-cap equities and agricultural staples points to a potential broad-based economic downturn.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Interest Rate Policy Uncertainty:</strong> A stark divergence exists between the 2-Year U.S. Note, where speculators are strongly net-long (COT Index: 69.25, Z-score: 0.94) [Source: row 6] anticipating lower rates, and the 10-Year U.S. Note, which shows significant net-short positioning (Net Short: -247298, COT Index: 48.62) [Source: row 7]. This implies market expectations for near-term rate cuts contrasting with long-term inflation or fiscal concerns, risking yield curve instability and central bank policy misalignments.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Investment Opportunities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Contrarian (Short Squeeze Potential) - Japanese Yen:</strong> Speculators hold an extreme net-short position (Net Short: -108488, COT Index: 1.34, Z-score: -2.61) with a `flag_squeeze_setup`=1 [Source: row 9]. This crowded bearish bet is highly vulnerable to short-covering, which could trigger a rapid price rally.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Contrarian (Short Squeeze Potential) - Corn:</strong> With an extreme speculative net-short position (COT Index: 1.14, Z-score: -2.71) and `flag_squeeze_setup`=1 [Source: row 22], Corn is ripe for a short squeeze. Any unexpected supply disruptions or demand increases could ignite a rapid price ascent.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mean Reversion (Long Exhaustion) - Gold:</strong> Speculative net-long positioning in Gold is at historical extremes (COT Index: 95.34, Z-score: 2.75) with `flag_exhaustion_risk`=1 [Source: row 17]. This overextended bullish conviction signals a high probability of a sharp pullback, offering a tactical shorting opportunity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Divergence Play - U.S. Treasury Yield Curve (2YR vs 10YR):</strong> Speculators are net-long 2YR U.S. Notes (COT Index: 69.25) [Source: row 6] and net-short 10YR U.S. Notes (COT Index: 48.62) [Source: row 7]. This presents a relative value opportunity to position for a bear steepener, anticipating short-term rates to fall while long-term rates rise.
