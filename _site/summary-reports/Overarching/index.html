    <h3>1) Executive Summary (≤ 120 words)</h3>
    <p data-bind="exec_summary">The macroeconomic landscape is marked by intensifying disinflationary pressures and significant labor market softening, occurring against a backdrop of easing liquidity and elevated financial stress. Key indicators show a persistent yield curve inversion, flagging recession risks. While core manufacturing remains robust (Durable Goods), broader economic growth signals are neutral to decelerating (Industrial Production, Sectoral Employment). Consumer sentiment and financial stress are deeply bearish, contrasting with an unwinding of Fed liquidity measures. This divergence points to a challenging environment for risk assets, favoring duration and safe-havens, yet with nuances from robust liquidity and select growth pockets. Overall bias is Neutral-to-Bearish.</p>

    <h3>3) Dominant Themes</h3>
    <ul data-bind="themes_list">
      <li>Broad Labor Market Softening: Multiple labor signals (Labor Turnover, Employment Composition, Weekly Hours, Job Flows) indicate increasing slack and decelerating dynamism, pointing to rising recession risks.</li>
      <li>Entrenched Disinflation: The Fed Inflation Signal is "COOL," while market-implied expectations (MIIE) are "STABLE" with an easing bias, suggesting persistent disinflationary pressures are weighing on price growth.</li>
      <li>Counter-Cyclical Liquidity Surge: Despite ongoing quantitative tightening (Fed Liquidity), robust M2 growth and a significant unwinding of the RRP facility are injecting substantial liquidity, easing financial conditions.</li>
      <li>Deeply Negative Sentiment &amp; Stress: Consumer confidence (UMich Sentiment) is severely deteriorated, and the Financial Stress Index shows a sharp uptick to a "Bearish" regime, indicating elevated risk aversion.</li>
      <li>Yield Curve Inversion Persists: The Treasury yield curve remains inverted, a historically reliable recession indicator, reinforcing a cautious outlook for economic growth.</li>

    <h3>4) Cross-Signal Interactions</h3>
    <p>Explain how signals reinforce or offset each other. Prioritize causal or historically reliable linkages.</p>
    <ul data-bind="crosslinks_bullets">
      <li>Aggressive liquidity injection via RRP unwind and M2 expansion (Liquidity) somewhat offsets the tightening effects of elevated real yields (Rates) and persistent yield curve inversion (Rates/Yield Curve).</li>
      <li>The pervasive disinflationary trend (Inflation: Fed Inflation, MIIE) is reinforcing expectations for lower policy rates implied by the inverted yield curve (Rates/Yield Curve), potentially supporting longer-duration assets.</li>
      <li>Widespread labor market softening (Labor: Turnover, Employment Composition, Job Flows, Weekly Hours) combined with deeply bearish consumer sentiment (Sentiment) and rising financial stress (Sentiment/Credit) strongly suggests impeding economic growth.</li>
      <li>Bullish core manufacturing orders (Growth: Durable Goods) conflict with decelerating overall industrial production (Growth) and broader labor market weakness, indicating a bifurcated economy or lagging effects.</li>
      <li>A weakening USD (FX) combined with disinflationary pressures and potential central bank easing could create a supportive environment for global equities and commodities, particularly precious metals.</li>

  <section id="regime-assessment" class="block">
    <h3>5) Regime Assessment</h3>
    <p><strong>Current Regime:</strong> <span data-bind="current_regime">Late Cycle / Disinflationary Downturn</span></p>
    <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> <span data-bind="regime_evidence">The persistent yield curve inversion (Rates/Yield Curve), significant labor market slack (Labor), deeply bearish consumer and financial sentiment (Sentiment), and the "COOL" Fed Inflation Signal (Inflation) all point to an economy moving deeper into a late-cycle slowdown with disinflationary pressures.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Historical Analogue(s):</strong> <span data-bind="regime_analogues">Periods preceding mild recessions, characterized by inverted yield curves, increasing labor market slack, and moderating inflation, such as late 2000 or late 2007, adjusted for the unique liquidity dynamics.</span></p>

    <h3>6) Asset-Class Implications (Evidence-Linked)</h3>
    <ul class="assets">
      <li><strong>Equities:</strong> <span data-bind="imp_equities">Bearish tilt. Increasing labor market slack (Labor) and deeply bearish consumer sentiment and financial stress (Sentiment) suggest headwinds for broad equity markets, favoring defensive sectors or quality.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Bonds/Duration:</strong> <span data-bind="imp_bonds">Bullish tilt. Persistent disinflation (Inflation), an inverted yield curve (Rates/Yield Curve), and flight-to-safety flows from rising financial stress (Sentiment) strongly support longer-duration bonds.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Credit:</strong> <span data-bind="imp_credit">Neutral tilt. Credit spreads remain "NORMAL" (Credit) reflecting reduced corporate funding stress, but slight upward momentum in spreads warrants cautious monitoring.</span></li>
      <li><strong>FX (USD):</strong> <span data-bind="imp_fx">Mildly bearish tilt. The USD Index signals a weakening dollar (FX), which could benefit non-USD denominated assets.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Commodities/Metals:</strong> <span data-bind="imp_commodities">Mixed tilt. Precious metals are bullish (safe-haven demand from stress, disinflationary policy easing potential, weakening USD). Industrial metals are bearish (growth headwinds from labor/sentiment, neutral industrial production, increased mining supply).</span></li>
      <li><strong>Other (if applicable):</strong> <span data-bind="imp_other">No tilt. There is insufficient evidence to provide a specific tilt for other asset classes.</span></li>

    <p class="tilts-note">State directional tilts (e.g., OW/UW/Neutral) only where the evidence is clear; otherwise say “no tilt.”</p>

  <section id="risk-checks" class="block">
    <h3>8) Risk Checks &amp; Contradictions</h3>
    <ul data-bind="risk_checks">
      <li>The strong "Bullish" signal from Durable Goods ex-Transportation (Growth) directly contradicts the broader weakening labor market and neutral industrial production, suggesting a potential bifurcation in the economy or a lagging effect.</li>
      <li>The substantial liquidity expansion from M2 and RRP unwinding (Liquidity) acts as a significant counter-force to the persistent yield curve inversion (Rates/Yield Curve) and rising financial stress (Sentiment), potentially muting the severity of a downturn.</li>
      <li>The rapid normalization of the VIX to "NORMAL" (Volatility) from recent "STRESSED" levels appears to conflict with the deeply bearish consumer sentiment and recent uptick in financial stress, implying that market participants may be underpricing systemic risk or that a relief rally is underway.</li>
      <li>While wage growth is moderating, the observed PPI-CPI divergence indicates some persistent upstream price pressure (Inflation: CPI vs PPI), which could re-emerge as a concern if consumer demand stabilizes unexpectedly.</li>
      <li>Underemployment risk remains neutral despite other labor signals weakening (Labor), which could indicate a slower deterioration in certain aspects of labor market health than implied by other metrics.</li>

    <h3>9) Confidence &amp; Data Quality</h3>
    <p><strong>Confidence Score (0–100):</strong> <span data-bind="confidence_score">65</span></p>
    <p><strong>Drivers of Confidence:</strong> <span data-bind="confidence_drivers">High confidence in the disinflationary trend and labor market softening due to broad signal agreement across multiple, frequently updated sources (Labor, Inflation). Liquidity dynamics are clear and strong. Yield curve inversion is a robust indicator.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Data Gaps/Latency:</strong> <span data-bind="data_gaps">Job Flows data is quarterly and lags significantly (latest Q4 2024), impacting real-time labor dynamism assessment.
