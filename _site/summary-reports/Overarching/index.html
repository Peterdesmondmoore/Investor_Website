    <h3>1) Executive Summary (≤ 120 words)</h3>
    <p data-bind="exec_summary">The macroeconomic landscape is marked by divergent forces, suggesting a cautious neutral stance for overall markets. Robust liquidity expansion, driven by declining overnight reverse repo usage and rising M2, is poised against a broadly weakening labor market, cooling inflation, and elevated market volatility. Consumer sentiment remains bearish, indicating demand headwinds. While core manufacturing shows some bullish momentum, broader employment indicators point to increasing slack and recession risk. This combination implies a disinflationary slowdown where asset quality and duration may be favored, despite liquidity support for risk assets.</p>

    <h3>3) Dominant Themes</h3>
    <ul data-bind="themes_list">
      <li>Persistent labor market softening and increasing slack signal recessionary risks, evidenced by bearish turnover and rising underemployment.</li>
      <li>Disinflationary pressures are mounting, with the Fed Inflation signal now "COOL" and market-implied expectations showing recent cooling momentum.</li>
      <li>Supportive liquidity conditions, driven by declining ON RRP and growing M2, are attempting to cushion broader economic headwinds.</li>
      <li>Market volatility is elevated to a "STRESSED" regime, while an inverted yield curve signals a defensive stance for risk assets.</li>
      <li>Consumer sentiment remains deeply bearish, indicating ongoing demand weakness despite pockets of strength in core manufacturing.</li>

    <p>Explain how signals reinforce or offset each other. Prioritize causal or historically reliable linkages.</p>
    <ul data-bind="crosslinks_bullets">
      <li>Weakening Labor + Cooling Inflation + Inverted Yield Curve ⇒ Disinflationary growth slowdown; favors duration and quality over cyclicals.</li>
      <li>Easing Liquidity + Bullish Durable Goods ⇒ Potential for selective strength in risk assets, providing a floor against recessionary pressures.</li>
      <li>Bearish Consumer Sentiment + Stressed Volatility + Strengthening USD (model) ⇒ Heightened risk aversion and tighter financial conditions, posing headwinds for broader equities.</li>
      <li>PPI outpacing CPI + easing Real Rates ⇒ Suggests some margin pressure for producers balanced by a more accommodative financial backdrop.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="regime-assessment" class="block">
    <h3>5) Regime Assessment</h3>
    <p><strong>Current Regime:</strong> <span data-bind="current_regime">Disinflationary Slowdown with Liquidity Cushion</span></p>
    <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> <span data-bind="regime_evidence">Cooling inflation (US Inflation COOL, MIIE cooling momentum) combined with weakening labor metrics (Turnover Bearish, Underemployment rising, Employment Composition slack rising) and bearish consumer sentiment points to a slowdown. However, strong liquidity (Fed Liquidity Expansion, M2 Bullish) is acting as a mitigating factor.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Historical Analogue(s):</strong> <span data-bind="regime_analogues">Periods of "soft landing" attempts with declining inflation and decelerating growth, where monetary policy shifts to ease while underlying economic activity moderates.</span></p>
  </section>

  <section id="asset-implications" class="block">
    <h3>6) Asset-Class Implications (Evidence-Linked)</h3>
    <ul class="assets">
      <li><strong>Equities:</strong> <span data-bind="imp_equities">Cautious/Neutral. Bearish consumer sentiment and rising volatility weigh, but easing liquidity and robust core manufacturing provide selective support; prefer quality and defensive sectors over broad cyclicals (UMich, Volatility, Durable Goods Ex-Trans, Fed Liquidity).</span></li>
      <li><strong>Bonds/Duration:</strong> <span data-bind="imp_bonds">Bullish. Disinflationary trends, an inverted yield curve, and easing real rates support demand for duration, despite some liquidity pushing into risk (US Inflation, Treasury Yield Curve, Real Interest Rates).</span></li>
      <li><strong>Credit:</strong> <span data-bind="imp_credit">Neutral. Spreads remain in a "NORMAL" regime, indicating no broad distress, but rising 3-month HY momentum warrants monitoring for potential tightening (Credit Spreads).</span></li>
      <li><strong>FX (USD):</strong> <span data-bind="imp_fx">Bullish. The model signals USD strength, which could reflect safe-haven demand amidst global slowdown concerns or tighter financial conditions (USD Index).</span></li>
      <li><strong>Commodities/Metals:</strong> <span data-bind="imp_commodities">Mixed. Precious metals (e.g., gold/silver) are bullish due to disinflationary trends, easing real rates, and flight to safety. Industrial metals are cautious due to slowing global growth and manufacturing moderation, despite liquidity support (US Inflation, Real Interest Rates, Market Volatility, Industrial Production).</span></li>
      <li><strong>Other (if applicable):</strong> <span data-bind="imp_other">No clear tilt due to insufficient distinct signals.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tilts-note">State directional tilts (e.g., OW/UW/Neutral) only where the evidence is clear; otherwise say “no tilt.”</p>

  <section id="risk-checks" class="block">
    <h3>8) Risk Checks &amp; Contradictions</h3>
    <ul data-bind="risk_checks">
      <li>The USD Index signal is "Bullish" despite some underlying metrics (6-month change) indicating weakness, which could incorrectly tighten financial conditions in the model's aggregate view.</li>
      <li>Strong positive liquidity signals (M2, Fed Liquidity) directly contradict the persistent bearishness in consumer sentiment and rising market volatility, posing uncertainty for asset class direction.</li>
      <li>While core manufacturing shows bullish momentum (Durable Goods), broader labor market health (Underemployment, Turnover) is clearly weakening, suggesting a potential divergence between industrial activity and overall economic demand.</li>
      <li>The "NEUTRAL" regime classification for several labor signals (LMT, Employment Comp, Weekly Hours) might mask underlying deterioration, as many metrics are near "COOL" thresholds or showing negative momentum.</li>
      <li>The "Bullish" signal for the Treasury Yield Curve implies a defensive stance, but could be interpreted differently by market participants depending on specific rate cut expectations, leading to varied asset price reactions.</li>

    <h3>9) Confidence &amp; Data Quality</h3>
    <p><strong>Confidence Score (0–100):</strong> <span data-bind="confidence_score">65</span></p>
    <p><strong>Drivers of Confidence:</strong> <span data-bind="confidence_drivers">High confidence in liquidity, inflation, and volatility signals due to clear trends and robust z-scores.

    <p><strong>Data Gaps/Latency:</strong> <span data-bind="data_gaps">Job Flows signal is quarterly (latest Q4 2024), leading to some latency in this specific labor component.
