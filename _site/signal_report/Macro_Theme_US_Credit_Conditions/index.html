<p><em>US Credit Conditions: synthesising credit spreads, financial stress and private credit dynamics.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>US credit conditions as of November 2025 are predominantly neutral, reflecting contained systemic financial stress and normalizing private credit growth. Corporate funding conditions remain moderate, with spreads within typical historical ranges. While some underlying stress indicators show minor elevation, their aggregate effect remains balanced, supporting an overall environment of non-extreme risk. Credit creation momentum has shifted from a decelerating phase to a stable regime, indicating a stabilization in economic activity-driven financing.</p>
<p>This assessment is based on the following indicators:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spread regime (HY & IG): Normal</li>
  <li>Financial stress state: Neutral</li>
  <li>Credit conditions composite: Neutral</li>
  <li>Private credit impulse: Stable</li>
  <li>Overall credit environment: Neutral, characterized by normalizing credit growth and contained systemic risk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Credit Spreads</h3>
<p>As of November 30, 2025, the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (HY OAS) is 3.00% and the US Corporate Master OAS (IG OAS) is 0.82%. The Credit Spreads Composite (CSC) z-score is -0.108351, placing the credit spread environment in a NORMAL regime. This indicates that while HY spreads are below the 3.5% threshold often associated with "EASY" conditions, the composite z-score does not meet the criteria for an "EASY" classification.</p>
<p>Recent dynamics indicate a slight positive momentum in 3-month annualized z-scores for both HY (0.695903) and IG (0.354995) spreads, suggesting a marginal widening trend. This follows a period in April 2025 where spreads briefly entered a TIGHTENING regime, with HY OAS reaching 3.94% and IG OAS at 1.09%, before reverting to current levels.</p>

<h3>2. Systemic Financial Stress</h3>
<p>The Financial Stress Composite for November 30, 2025, registers at 0.045316, indicating a Neutral regime for systemic financial stress. This composite integrates the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4), high-yield option-adjusted spreads (HY OAS), and the inverted 10-Year minus 2-Year Treasury Yield Spread (T10Y2Y).</p>
<p>While the STLFSI4's z-score for November 2025 is 1.103935, suggesting an elevated relative stress contribution from this component, its impact is balanced by other factors. The HY OAS z-score is -0.427091, reflecting lower credit spread stress. Concurrently, the 10Y2Y spread is positive at 0.55%, translating to an inverted z-score of -0.540896 that mitigates stress from the yield curve perspective. The combined effect results in an overall balanced assessment of financial stress.</p>

<h3>3. Credit Conditions Composite</h3>
<p>The Credit Conditions Composite for November 30, 2025, is -0.292944, categorizing the environment as Neutral. This composite blends robust-normalized measures of HY OAS (3.00%), BBB OAS (1.05%), and VIXCLS (17.21).</p>
<p>The index has transitioned from an Easing regime, observed in early 2025 (e.g., -0.90 in January), to a Neutral stance, which has been maintained since March. This indicates a funding backdrop where corporate bond spreads and equity volatility are within typical ranges, suggesting neither significant restriction nor aggressive stimulation of capital flows.</p>

<h3>4. Private Credit Impulse</h3>
<p>The Private Credit Impulse signal indicates a Stable credit growth regime, with the latest available composite value for November 30, 2025, at 0.444793 based on partial data. The last fully available composite for September 30, 2025, was 0.112817, also indicating a Stable regime. This composite measures the six-month annualized growth momentum across total bank credit, commercial & industrial loans, and total consumer loans.</p>
<p>The impulse has recovered from a Decelerating regime in early 2025 (e.g., -1.04 in January) to its current Stable state. For the most recent full component data from September 2025, total bank credit growth (TOTBKCR_ann6) was 0.06, business loans (BUSLOANS_ann6) was 0.01, and consumer loans (TOTALSL_ann6) was 0.02. This overall momentum suggests a normalization of private credit creation after a period of contraction.</p>

<h3>5. Synthesised US Credit Conditions Assessment</h3>
<p>The current US credit landscape can be characterized as a broadly Neutral environment, marked by contained systemic risks and normalizing private credit growth. While individual components may exhibit nuances, the aggregate assessment points to stable and non-extreme conditions across various credit and financial market indicators.</p>

<h3>6. Forward Risks</h3>
<h4>Upside / Supportive</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Continued credit growth: Sustained momentum in private credit creation would support economic activity.</li>
  <li>Contained volatility: Persistent low equity and credit market volatility would maintain a stable risk environment.</li>
  <li>Persistently tight spreads: Further narrowing of credit spreads or maintenance of current tight levels would signal robust corporate health and ample liquidity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Downside / Stress</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Spread widening: A material increase in HY or IG OAS would indicate rising default or liquidity premia.</li>
  <li>Stress composite rising: An upward trend in the Financial Stress Composite would signal increasing systemic risk.</li>
  <li>Renewed deceleration in credit growth: A return to negative momentum in the Private Credit Impulse would suggest a tightening of financial conditions for businesses and consumers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The current neutral and stable credit environment generally supports risk sentiment, suggesting a backdrop conducive to corporate activity and moderate growth. Default risk within corporate credit markets appears contained, as evidenced by prevailing tight spreads and a non-stressed credit composite. This setting implies a normalized funding cost environment, which can support capital expenditure and M&A activity.</p>
<p>While the absence of significant stress signals is constructive, the shift from "Easing" to "Neutral" regimes in some indicators suggests a transition towards more typical conditions, rather than a continued strong tailwind for risk assets. This implies a market that is not experiencing extreme liquidity constraints but also not in a phase of aggressive financial loosening.</p></div></section>
