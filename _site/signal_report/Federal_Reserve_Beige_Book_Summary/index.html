<hr>

<h3>National Backdrop</h3>
<p>Overall economic activity remained largely unchanged since the prior report, with most Districts noting flat conditions, while two reported modest declines and one observed modest growth. This represents a slight net softening compared to the prior period where more Districts reported growth or no change. Consumer spending declined further, although higher-end retail segments showed resilience. Manufacturing activity improved somewhat across most Districts, despite persistent headwinds from tariffs and associated uncertainty. Nonfinancial services activity was generally flat to down, and conditions in real estate and interest rate-sensitive sectors remained mixed, with residential showing more pronounced declines in some areas while office markets saw early signs of recovery in others. The federal government shutdown notably impacted consumer purchases and community services in several regions. Overall outlooks were largely unchanged, with some manufacturers expressing optimism but many contacts citing increased risks of slower activity ahead.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Labour Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Employment levels declined slightly over the current reporting period, a softening from the largely stable conditions reported previously. Weaker labor demand was noted by approximately half of the Districts, accompanied by an uptick in layoff announcements, although most firms opted to limit headcounts through hiring freezes, attrition, and replacement-only hiring rather than widespread layoffs. Employers increasingly adjusted workers' hours to manage business volume, and Artificial Intelligence technologies were noted as replacing entry-level positions or enhancing productivity sufficiently to curb new hiring. While labor availability generally improved, challenges persisted in finding workers for specific skilled positions and due to fewer immigrant workers. Wage growth remained modest overall, a slight moderation from the prior period's "modest to moderate" pace, though specific sectors like manufacturing, construction, and health care continued to face moderate wage pressure, exacerbated by rising health insurance premiums.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Prices & Cost Pressures</h3>
<p>Prices rose moderately during the reporting period, a continued trend. Input cost pressures remained robust and widespread, particularly in manufacturing and retail, largely driven by tariff-induced increases, as well as rising costs for insurance, utilities, technology, and health care, consistent with the prior report. The extent to which firms could pass through these higher costs to customers varied, influenced by demand, competitive pressures, and consumer price sensitivity, leading to more explicit reports of margin compression or financial strain for businesses. Some specific material prices, such as steel and lumber, continued to decline due to sluggish demand or reduced tariff rates. Looking ahead, contacts generally anticipated persistent upward cost pressures, but their plans to raise selling prices in the near term were mixed, reflecting the ongoing struggle with pricing power.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Sector Themes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer activity:</strong> Spending declined further overall, contrasting with the prior report's slight dip, with auto sales declining post-EV tax credit expiry. High-income consumers remained resilient in luxury goods and travel, while low- and middle-income households continued to pull back, seek discounts, and showed increased price sensitivity, amplified by government shutdown impacts.</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Activity increased somewhat nationally, a positive shift from the varied and challenging conditions reported previously. However, tariffs and related uncertainties continued to act as significant headwinds, affecting input costs and demand for exports. Some districts noted boosts from AI data center investments.</li>
  <li><strong>Services:</strong> Nonfinancial services revenues were mostly flat to down, a slight deterioration from largely flat conditions in the prior period. Professional and business services saw mixed demand, with some growth attributed to tax law changes and AI adoption, while leisure, hospitality, and some consumer services continued to soften, particularly due to government shutdown effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Housing & construction:</strong> Residential real estate saw a net decline in construction and varying home sales activity, with some price moderation, a more pronounced slowdown than in the prior mixed report. Commercial real estate remained mixed; while some office markets showed early recovery signs and data center construction boosted activity, other consumer-facing commercial segments softened, and nonresidential construction declined modestly in some areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Banking & credit:</strong> Loan demand was mixed to slightly lower overall, a modest decline from the prior period's mixed reports. Consumer loan delinquencies and defaults notably rose in several districts, indicating a deterioration in credit quality for households and small businesses. Lending standards remained tight or tightened further.</li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture & energy:</strong> Conditions were largely stable overall, a slight improvement from the prior report's "generally down" assessment, but persistent challenges included low oil and crop prices, ongoing drought in some areas, and trade policy impacts on exports. Energy demand showed moderate growth in some segments, particularly from data centers.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Regional Dispersion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stronger districts:</strong> The Chicago District reported slight increases across most sectors including employment, consumer spending, business spending, construction, and manufacturing. Boston's economic activity expanded slightly, driven by renewed home sales strength and modest manufacturing growth. Cleveland noted a slight increase in activity, particularly in professional and business services.</li>
  <li><strong>Softer districts:</strong> New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts reported modest declines or weakening economic activity. St. Louis and San Francisco observed flat to slightly down activity, with St. Louis noting a pessimistic outlook due to demand slowdowns and the government shutdown. Philadelphia's activity was further disrupted by the government shutdown.</li>
  <li><strong>Common constraints:</strong> Widespread issues included elevated uncertainty regarding economic and policy outlooks, persistent tariff-related cost pressures leading to margin compression, and the impact of the federal government shutdown on various sectors and social services. Labor supply for skilled positions and from immigration policy changes also remained a constraint, alongside consumer price sensitivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> The federal government shutdown was a prominent new disruption, explicitly cited across multiple districts (NY, Philly, St. Louis, KC, Dallas, SF) impacting consumer spending, business confidence, and community services. AI's role in labor markets, either replacing entry-level jobs or boosting productivity, was highlighted in several regions (Boston, NY, Philly, Cleveland, KC, SF), as was the bifurcated consumer spending pattern between resilient higher-income households and cautious lower-to-middle-income segments.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Signals to Watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth risks:</strong> Further softening in consumer demand, especially among lower and middle-income segments, compounded by continued economic uncertainty and policy disruptions like government shutdowns. Persistent tariff impacts on manufacturing and export-oriented sectors may weigh on overall activity.</li>
  <li><strong>Labour inflections:</strong> The ongoing shift towards hiring freezes, replacement-only hiring, and attrition over direct layoffs, coupled with increasing adoption of AI reducing demand for entry-level workers. Watch for sustained shortages in skilled trades and the overall impact of immigration policies on labor availability.</li>
  <li><strong>Inflation persistence:</strong> Continued upward pressure on input costs from tariffs, insurance, and energy, with firms' varying ability to pass these costs to consumers. The extent of margin compression across industries will indicate pricing power dynamics, while declines in certain material prices could offer some relief.</li>
  <li><strong>Capital investment:</strong> Signs of business capital expenditure, particularly for automation and AI infrastructure, against a backdrop of general caution and delayed longer-term investment plans due to economic and policy uncertainty.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial stress:</strong> The continued rise in consumer loan delinquencies and defaults, particularly among households and small businesses, and increasing reliance on credit by low- and middle-income consumers. Monitoring the funding stability of nonprofits amid rising demand for social services.</li>
