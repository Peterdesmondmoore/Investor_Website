  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Federal Reserve Beige Book — Executive Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><h2>The Beige Book: November 2025 Summary</h2>
<h3>National Backdrop</h3>
<p>Overall U.S. economic activity remained largely unchanged since the prior report, though with a notable shift towards softening as two Districts reported modest declines and only one experienced modest growth, contrasting with the previous period's more balanced mix of slight growth and softening. Consumer spending further declined nationally, exacerbated by the government shutdown and the expiration of a federal EV tax credit, though higher-end retail remained resilient. Manufacturing activity saw a modest increase overall, yet tariffs and trade policy uncertainty persisted as significant headwinds. Activity in the nonfinancial services sector was generally flat to down, while real estate conditions varied, with some residential construction declines and a mixed picture in commercial real estate, albeit with some recovery in office markets. Energy and agriculture sectors were largely stable, but faced challenges from low commodity prices and specific supply issues, while community organizations reported increased demand for assistance due to federal benefit disruptions.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Labour Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Employment levels declined slightly across the nation, with roughly half of the Districts observing weaker labor demand, a notable softening from the prior period's largely stable conditions. Layoff announcements saw an uptick, yet firms primarily managed headcounts through hiring freezes, attrition, and replacement-only strategies, with some adjusting hours rather than employee numbers. Artificial intelligence continued to impact the labor market, replacing entry-level roles or enhancing productivity to curb new hiring. While labor availability generally improved, specific skilled positions and a reduced immigrant workforce still presented hiring challenges in several areas. Wage growth maintained a modest pace, though some sectors like manufacturing, construction, and health care experienced moderate wage pressures due to persistent labor supply tightness, further compounded by rising health insurance premiums.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Prices & Cost Pressures</h3>
<p>Prices rose moderately during the reporting period, a slight easing in the pace of increase in some areas compared to the prior report but generally remaining elevated. Input cost pressures were widespread across manufacturing and retail, primarily driven by tariffs, and persistently high costs for insurance, utilities, technology, and health care. Firms' ability to pass through these elevated costs varied widely, influenced by demand, competitive pressures, and consumer price sensitivity, leading to increased reports of margin compression. However, prices for certain materials continued to decline due to sluggish demand or reduced tariff rates. Looking ahead, contacts largely anticipate ongoing upward cost pressures, but their plans for near-term price increases remained mixed.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Sector Themes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer activity:</strong> Overall consumer spending declined further, with a clear bifurcation where higher-income households remained resilient but lower- and middle-income consumers showed increased signs of financial distress, relying more on debt and exercising caution with discretionary purchases. Auto sales declined following the expiration of the federal EV tax credit, and leisure and hospitality activity remained mixed nationally, with some regions seeing slight growth in leisure travel but overall cautious discretionary spending.</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Manufacturing activity nationally increased somewhat, a slight improvement from the prior period's varied conditions, but still contended with tariffs and trade policy uncertainty as significant headwinds. Demand for manufactured goods declined slightly in some Districts (Cleveland, Philadelphia) while increasing modestly in others (Chicago, Dallas), with AI data centers noted as a specific driver of demand in certain areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Services:</strong> Activity in the nonfinancial services sector was largely flat to down, with moderate to steep declines reported in leisure and hospitality and information services in some Districts. Professional and business services showed mixed demand, with some growth attributed to tax law changes and AI adoption, while others faced a general slowdown.</li>
  <li><strong>Housing & construction:</strong> Residential real estate activity eased slightly in many areas, with varied home sales and persistent weakness attributed to high mortgage rates and affordability issues, though some areas (Boston) saw strong home sales. Commercial real estate conditions were mixed, with office markets showing signs of recovery in some major cities, but overall construction activity remained subdued due to high costs, labor shortages, and uncertain funding, though data centers were a consistent bright spot.</li>
  <li><strong>Banking & credit:</strong> Loan demand remained mixed, declining overall in some Districts but increasing modestly in others, particularly for residential mortgages due to lower rates. Credit standards were generally tightening or unchanged across most loan types. A concerning trend of rising consumer loan delinquencies was noted in several Districts, alongside struggles for small businesses to obtain credit.</li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture & energy:</strong> Agricultural conditions remained weak in many Districts, burdened by low commodity prices, trade policy volatility impacting exports, and adverse weather conditions like low river levels increasing costs. Energy activity was generally stable, with moderate growth in some segments, particularly due to demand from data centers, but concerns persisted regarding low oil prices and slowing investment.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Regional Dispersion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stronger districts:</strong> The <em>Boston</em> District experienced slight economic expansion, driven by renewed strength in home sales and modest growth in manufacturing sales, with a cautiously optimistic outlook. <em>Cleveland</em> reported a slight increase in business activity, supported by moderate growth in professional and business services and a boost to some manufacturers from AI data centers. <em>Chicago</em> saw slight increases across most sectors, including employment, consumer spending, and manufacturing. <em>Richmond</em> continued modest economic growth, with modest consumer spending and a slight increase in travel and tourism.</li>
  <li><strong>Softer districts:</strong> <em>New York</em> reported a modest decline in economic activity, marked by slight employment falls and consumer spending declines, and continued declines in the service sector. <em>Philadelphia's</em> activity trended down, experiencing modest overall declines further disrupted by a government shutdown, with falling employment and modest manufacturing declines. <em>Minneapolis</em> was flat on balance with slight employment decreases and lower consumer spending, and weakened agricultural conditions. <em>Kansas City</em> observed a slight slowdown in growth, with declining consumer activity and employment, and subdued oil/gas and agriculture sectors. <em>Dallas</em> experienced a slight weakening in activity, with declines in nonfinancial services, retail, and banking, and a weak housing market. <em>St. Louis</em> reported unchanged economic activity and employment, with a slowdown in demand and declining consumer spending, alongside strained agricultural conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>Common constraints:</strong> Tariffs were a widespread concern, driving up input costs for manufacturers and retailers across multiple Districts (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Dallas). Economic uncertainty and consumer price sensitivity were commonly cited as dampening demand, particularly affecting lower and middle-income households across the nation. Labor market adjustments, including increased reliance on attrition and temporary hiring, and the emerging impact of AI on certain job roles, were observed in many regions.</li>
  <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> The <em>Philadelphia</em> and <em>Kansas City</em> Districts explicitly highlighted the negative economic impact of the federal government shutdown on consumer purchases and business activity. <em>Cleveland</em> and <em>Kansas City</em> noted demand boosts for manufacturing and professional services specifically tied to AI data center construction. The <em>St. Louis</em> District faced unique challenges in agriculture due to low Mississippi River water levels increasing transportation costs.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Signals to Watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth risks:</strong> Further declines in broad consumer spending, particularly among lower- and middle-income segments, persistent impacts of tariffs on manufacturing profitability and supply chains, and the ongoing uncertainty from government policy and trade disputes.</li>
  <li><strong>Labour inflections:</strong> The broadening trend of employment declines, increased use of attrition and hiring freezes over outright layoffs, the accelerating displacement of entry-level roles by AI, and persistent difficulties in sourcing skilled workers or those impacted by immigration policy changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Inflation persistence:</strong> The continued robustness of non-labor input cost pressures, particularly from tariffs, insurance, health care, and energy, and the struggle of firms to pass these costs through to consumers without impacting demand and margins.</li>
  <li><strong>Capital investment:</strong> Business cautiousness leading to delayed long-term capital expenditures, contrasted with targeted investments in AI and automation for productivity gains, and the concentration of new commercial construction in data centers.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial stress:</strong> A sustained increase in consumer loan delinquencies and defaults, ongoing struggles for small businesses to access credit and manage rising costs, and increasing demand for services from community support organizations amidst funding challenges.</li>
