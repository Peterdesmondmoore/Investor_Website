  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Federal Reserve Beige Book — Executive Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><h2>The Beige Book Summary: November 2025</h2>
<p>This summary synthesizes economic conditions across the Federal Reserve Districts as reported in the November 2025 Beige Book, highlighting changes and momentum since the prior October 2025 report. Overall economic activity remained little changed for most Districts, with two noting a modest decline and one reporting modest growth, representing a slight softening compared to the prior report's broader range of growth. Consumer spending continued its downward trend, though high-income households sustained luxury purchases. Manufacturing activity generally increased somewhat, a modest improvement from the previous varied conditions, yet persistent headwinds from tariffs and trade policy uncertainty remained. The outlook remained largely unchanged, characterized by both increased risks of slower activity and some pockets of optimism, particularly among manufacturers. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></p>
<hr>

<h3>Labour Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Employment levels declined slightly across the Districts, a shift from the largely stable conditions reported previously, with approximately half of the Districts noting weaker labor demand. Employers increasingly utilized hiring freezes, replacement-only hiring, and attrition to limit headcounts, rather than widespread layoffs, though an uptick in layoff announcements was noted. Some firms reported adjusting workers' hours to manage business volume, and the influence of artificial intelligence in reducing the need for entry-level positions or boosting worker productivity was cited. Labor availability generally improved, making it easier to find workers, but shortages persisted for specific skilled positions and for roles reliant on immigrant labor. Wage growth remained modest overall, consistent with the prior period, though certain sectors like manufacturing, construction, and health care experienced more moderate wage pressures due to tighter supply in those specific areas, with rising health insurance premiums continuing to contribute to higher labor costs. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></p>
<hr>

<h3>Prices & Cost Pressures</h3>
<p>Prices rose moderately during the reporting period, a continued trend, with input cost pressures remaining widespread and robust, particularly in manufacturing and retail. Tariff-induced cost increases were a significant factor for many businesses, affecting raw materials, equipment, and chemical products, with some manufacturers having exhausted pre-tariff inventory. Beyond tariffs, rising costs for insurance, utilities, technology, and health care continued to be widely reported across Districts. Pricing power remained mixed and constrained by demand elasticity, competitive pressures, and consumer sensitivity, leading to margin compression for many firms, while prices for certain materials like steel and lumber declined due to sluggish demand. Looking ahead, contacts largely anticipate persistent upward cost pressures, but plans for passing these increases on to consumers in the near term remained varied, with some firms absorbing costs to maintain market share. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></p>

<h3>Sector Themes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer activity:</strong> Consumer spending declined further overall, continuing a softening trend, with higher-end retail remaining resilient while lower- and middle-income households exhibited caution and increased price sensitivity. Auto sales saw declines following the expiration of federal EV tax credits, contrasting with a boost in the prior period. Travel and tourism activity was largely flat to slightly down, marked by cautious discretionary spending and some negative impacts from the government shutdown. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Manufacturing activity increased somewhat across most Districts, an improvement from the prior period's varied conditions, but tariffs and associated uncertainty continued to be a notable headwind, impacting planning and profitability. New orders and shipments showed mixed trends, with some areas reporting modest growth (e.g., Boston, Chicago) and others noting declines (e.g., New York, Cleveland). <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Services:</strong> Revenues in the nonfinancial services sector were mostly flat to down, indicating a general softening compared to the prior report's mixed activity. Business services showed some resilience in areas like professional and business services (Cleveland) and IT (Boston), but overall demand for services faced headwinds, exacerbated by the government shutdown for some. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Housing & construction:</strong> Residential construction activity saw declines in some Districts while remaining unchanged in others, with home sales activity varying and generally weak. Lower mortgage rates offered some support, but high prices and limited affordability persisted. Commercial real estate activity was largely unchanged overall, though some Districts noted an ongoing recovery in the office market and strong demand from data center construction. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Banking & credit:</strong> Loan demand was mixed across Districts, with overall demand declining in some areas (New York, Dallas) and increasing moderately in others (Cleveland, San Francisco), especially for residential mortgages. Credit quality remained generally strong, but an ongoing rise in consumer delinquencies and defaults was reported across several Districts. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture & energy:</strong> Conditions in both sectors were largely stable, an improvement from the prior report which noted general declines. However, challenges persisted due to a low-price environment for oil and some crops, with concerns over trade policy and input costs affecting agricultural exports and profitability. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Regional Dispersion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stronger districts:</strong> The <em>Cleveland</em> District's business activity increased slightly after being flat, driven by professional and business services and a boost to manufacturing from AI data centers. <em>Chicago</em> also reported a slight increase in overall economic activity across most sectors, an improvement from its prior flat assessment. <em>Minneapolis</em> activity moved from slight contraction to flat. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Softer districts:</strong> <em>New York</em> saw a modest decline in activity, worsening slightly from a prior slight decline, with employment falling and consumer spending softening further. <em>Philadelphia</em> experienced modest declines across most sectors, a notable deterioration from its prior slight increase, significantly impacted by the government shutdown. <em>Dallas</em> activity weakened slightly, moving from flat previously, with worsened outlooks. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Common constraints:</strong> Persistent tariff and trade policy uncertainty, rising input costs (especially for insurance and health care premiums), heightened consumer price sensitivity and cautious discretionary spending, and labor supply challenges for specific skilled positions and foreign-born workers. The federal government shutdown also presented a common disruptive factor. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> <em>Boston</em> maintained slight expansion primarily due to strong home sales, diverging from general weakness in residential real estate. <em>Chicago</em> reported a broad-based slight increase across most sectors, indicating more uniform, albeit modest, positive momentum. <em>Kansas City</em> noted that firms anticipate only passing through a small share (20 percent) of input cost increases, highlighting strong competitive pressures on pricing power. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Signals to Watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth risks:</strong> The impact of government shutdowns on demand and service delivery, the persistence of tariff-related uncertainty affecting manufacturing and trade, softening consumer confidence, and continued low oil and crop prices remain key downside risks. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Labour inflections:</strong> The increasing role of AI in reducing entry-level hiring, a broader shift towards attrition and reduced hours over layoffs, and persistent shortages for skilled workers (e.g., IT, trades, healthcare) despite general improvements in labor availability, suggest a rebalancing and evolving labor market. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Inflation persistence:</strong> Continued robust input cost pressures, particularly from tariffs, insurance, and healthcare, alongside mixed pricing power among firms, indicate ongoing inflation challenges, with some contacts expecting price increases to extend into 2026. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Capital investment:</strong> Business capital expenditure plans are mixed, with some firms delaying investments due to uncertainty, while others are increasing spending on automation, AI infrastructure, and domestic capacity expansion, potentially signaling a bifurcation in investment cycles. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Financial stress:</strong> The ongoing rise in consumer loan delinquencies, particularly for low- and middle-income households, and small businesses facing difficulties obtaining credit or managing funding, point to accumulating financial stress in specific segments of the economy. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
