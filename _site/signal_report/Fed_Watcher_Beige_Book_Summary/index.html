<p><em>Descriptive synthesis of current US economic conditions based on district-level reporting.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3>National Backdrop</h3>
<p>Economic activity across the United States remained largely unchanged since the previous report, with two Federal Reserve Districts noting modest declines and one reporting modest growth. Consumer spending experienced further declines overall, though higher-end retail segments showed resilience. Manufacturing activity increased somewhat despite ongoing challenges from tariffs and associated uncertainty. Revenues in the nonfinancial services sector were generally flat to down, and overall loan demand was mixed. Outlooks were largely unchanged, with some contacts expressing increased risk of slower activity in the coming months, while others, particularly manufacturers, noted optimism. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></p>
<hr>
<h3>Labour Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Employment declined slightly across the nation, with roughly half of the Districts reporting weaker labor demand. While there was an uptick in layoff announcements, most employers managed headcounts through hiring freezes, replacement-only hiring, and attrition. Several firms adjusted hours worked rather than modifying employment levels, and some noted artificial intelligence replacing entry-level positions or boosting worker productivity. Employers generally found it easier to secure workers, though specific skilled positions and the availability of immigrant workers remained areas of difficulty. Wage growth was modest overall, with some moderate pressures in manufacturing, construction, and health care sectors due to tighter labor supply, and rising health insurance premiums continued to exert upward pressure on labor costs. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></p>
<hr>
<h3>Prices & Cost Pressures</h3>
<p>Prices generally rose at a moderate pace during the reporting period. Input cost pressures were widespread in manufacturing and retail, largely attributed to tariff-induced increases, with some manufacturers noting they had depleted pre-tariff inventory. Contacts also cited rising costs for insurance, utilities, technology, and health care. The ability to pass through these higher input costs to customers varied based on demand, competitive dynamics, and consumer price sensitivity, leading to reports of margin compression for many firms. While prices for certain materials declined due to sluggish demand or deferred tariffs, contacts widely anticipated upward cost pressures to persist, although near-term plans for raising selling prices were mixed. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></p>
<hr>
<h3>Sector Themes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer activity:</strong> Consumer spending declined further overall, with low- and middle-income households showing increased caution and financial stress (Atlanta, St. Louis), while higher-end retail remained resilient (New York). Sales of electric vehicles declined following the expiration of federal tax credits. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Activity increased somewhat nationally, with modest growth noted in Boston and Chicago, and resilience observed in Dallas. Tariffs and supply chain uncertainty remained significant headwinds, though some manufacturers reported boosts from AI data center demand (Cleveland). <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Services:</strong> Revenues in the nonfinancial services sector were mostly flat to down, with declines in New York and Dallas, but slight to moderate increases in professional and business services in Boston and Cleveland. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Housing & construction:</strong> Residential construction and home sales activity varied, with some districts like Atlanta and Dallas seeing slight declines due to high mortgage rates, while Boston reported renewed strength in home sales. Commercial real estate generally improved (New York, Atlanta), driven by demand for office properties and data centers, but overall construction activity declined sharply in some areas. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Banking & credit:</strong> Loan demand was mixed, with overall declines in consumer and commercial lending in some districts (New York, Dallas, Philadelphia) while Cleveland reported moderate increases. Underwriting standards tightened, particularly for business loans and commercial mortgages, and delinquencies rose for households and small businesses in several regions (St. Louis, Richmond, Cleveland). <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture & energy:</strong> Conditions in agriculture remained subdued in many areas due to low crop prices and trade tensions (Kansas City, Minneapolis, Dallas), despite strong harvests in some regions. Energy activity was flat to moderately up (Atlanta, Dallas), with strong demand for primary energy sources, though oil and gas activity in Kansas City declined slightly due to low oil prices. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Regional Dispersion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stronger districts:</strong> The Chicago District reported slight increases in overall economic activity, including employment, consumer spending, and manufacturing. Boston also noted a slight expansion, particularly in home sales. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Softer districts:</strong> New York and Philadelphia experienced modest declines in economic activity, with Philadelphia citing further disruption from the government shutdown. Dallas and Kansas City also reported slight weakening, especially in consumer-facing services and retail. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Common constraints:</strong> Tariffs and related uncertainty were a widespread headwind, impacting manufacturing costs, pricing power, and investment decisions across multiple districts (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Dallas). The federal government shutdown also broadly affected demand and social services in many regions (Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, San Francisco). <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> Minneapolis noted that an apparent increase in layoff anecdotes had not translated into higher jobless claims. In New York, higher-end retail spending remained resilient despite an overall decline in consumer spending. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Signals to Watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth risks:</strong> Observed cautious discretionary spending among consumers (Atlanta, Kansas City); continued economic slowdown, tariff concerns, and heightened uncertainty dampening business outlooks (Dallas, St. Louis); and the lingering impact of the government shutdown on demand for services and social programs (Philadelphia, San Francisco). <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Labour inflections:</strong> Businesses increasingly using AI to replace entry-level positions or improve productivity (National Summary, Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, San Francisco); a preference for attrition and hiring freezes over layoffs for headcount management (National Summary, Atlanta, Cleveland); and ongoing difficulties in finding skilled workers despite overall easier hiring conditions (National Summary, San Francisco). <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Inflation persistence:</strong> Persistent input cost pressures from tariffs, insurance, utility, and health care premiums (National Summary, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis); varied pass-through rates indicating margin pressure for some firms (National Summary, Philadelphia); and expectations of continued upward cost pressures in the coming months. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Capital investment:</strong> Pick-up in capital spending plans among manufacturers in some districts (New York, Chicago); firms beginning to dust off expansion and equipment upgrade plans (Kansas City); and strong demand for AI data center construction driving activity in some manufacturing and commercial real estate sectors (Cleveland, San Francisco). <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Financial stress:</strong> Increased reliance on debt for household expenses among low- and moderate-income consumers (Atlanta, New York, Dallas); and an ongoing rise in consumer and small business loan delinquencies and defaults reported across several districts (Philadelphia, St. Louis, Richmond). <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a></li>
