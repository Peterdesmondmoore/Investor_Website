<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>
The US monetary landscape currently reflects a significant shift toward accommodative conditions, predominantly driven by Federal Reserve liquidity dynamics. The overall Fed Liquidity Composite registered an 'Expansion' regime as of November 30, 2025, marking a continuation from July 2025. This expansion is primarily attributable to a substantial reduction in Overnight Reverse Repo (ON RRP) usage, which functionally eases liquidity. Concurrently, the M2 Money Supply maintained a 'Bullish' regime as of October 1, 2025, reflecting positive growth and momentum, although its contribution to the composite for November 2025 defaulted to 'Neutral' due to data availability. The 10-year real interest rate, as of November 1, 2025, is in a 'Neutral' regime, indicating a stabilization of real yields relative to their medium-term trend.
</p>
<p>
The combined signals suggest a less restrictive monetary environment, with strong liquidity injections from non-traditional channels (ON RRP unwind) partially offsetting the ongoing balance sheet reduction. Real rates are no longer signaling tightening pressure, contributing to an overall supportive, or at least less prohibitive, monetary backdrop.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fed Liquidity Condition:</strong> Expansion</li>
  <li><strong>M2 Regime (as of Oct 2025):</strong> Bullish</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Rate Regime:</strong> Neutral</li>
  <li><strong>Overall Monetary Tone:</strong> Less restrictive, with emerging supportive trends.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Federal Reserve Liquidity Dynamics</h3>
<p>
The Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite is classified in an 'Expansion' regime, registering a value of 1.30 as of November 30, 2025. This composite reading has maintained an 'Expansion' classification since July 2025. The primary driver of this expansion is the 'Bullish' signal from Overnight Reverse Repo (ON RRP) usage, with an inverted YoY change of -96.17% and a 3-month change of -90.29% as of November 30, 2025. This indicates a substantial decline in RRP balances, which is interpreted as a significant injection of liquidity into the system.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, Federal Reserve Total Assets (WALCL) and Reserve Balances (WRESBAL) continue to signal 'Bearish' conditions. Total Assets exhibited a -5.11% YoY change and -0.77% 3-month change as of November 30, 2025. Reserve Balances recorded a -10.26% YoY change and -10.18% 3-month change over the same period. These 'Bearish' signals reflect the ongoing quantitative tightening process, which removes liquidity. The M2 Money Supply input for the composite was recorded as 'Neutral' for November 30, 2025, due to the non-availability of M2 data for that month, defaulting according to the composite methodology.
</p>

<h3>2. Money Supply (M2)</h3>
<p>
The M2 Money Supply, as of its latest available data on October 1, 2025, is in a 'Bullish' regime. This classification is supported by a Year-over-Year growth rate of 4.65% and a 3-month momentum of 1.22%. The M2 methodology classifies the signal as 'Bullish' if YoY growth exceeds 6.0% or 3-month momentum exceeds 1.0%, or if YoY growth is between 2.0% and 6.0% with 3-month momentum between -1.0% and 1.0% (neutral), or in this case, 3M momentum exceeding 1.0%. The sustained positive momentum and improving annual growth indicate an expansionary phase in broad money supply.
</p>

<h3>3. Real Interest Rate Trend</h3>
<p>
The US 10-Year Real Yield (DFII10) signal indicates a 'Neutral' regime as of November 1, 2025. The current real yield stands at 1.77%, while its 6-month moving average trend is 1.885%. According to the methodology, a 'Neutral' signal occurs when the real yield is within ±0.05% of its trend. This suggests that real interest rates are currently consolidating and are not exerting significant tightening or easing pressure on financial conditions relative to their recent medium-term trajectory.
</p>

<h3>4. Synthesised Monetary Regime</h3>
<p>
The synthesised view of US monetary conditions points to an environment marked by overall liquidity expansion despite ongoing balance sheet reduction. The substantial liquidity impulse from the unwind of the ON RRP facility has been the dominant factor pushing the composite into an 'Expansion' regime, complemented by the 'Bullish' trend in broad money supply. The stabilization of real interest rates in a 'Neutral' regime suggests a pause in the prior tightening narrative.

<h3>5. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Easing / Supportive Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Persistently positive liquidity impulse from continued ON RRP reduction.</li>
  <li>Stabilising or falling real yields, reducing the cost of capital.</li>
  <li>Continuation in M2 growth, sustaining broad liquidity.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tightening / Reversal Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Renewed increase in real yields, signalling higher real funding costs.</li>
  <li>Reversal in ON RRP dynamics (e.g., increase in usage), withdrawing liquidity.</li>
  <li>Deceleration in money growth (M2), indicating tightening of broad liquidity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>
The current combination of a Federal Reserve Liquidity 'Expansion' regime, a 'Bullish' M2 Money Supply (as of its last available data point), and a 'Neutral' real interest rate environment implies a backdrop that is becoming less restrictive for financial markets. Funding conditions appear to be easing, primarily due to the significant reduction in ON RRP balances, which can translate into greater availability of capital within the financial system. This easing may reduce pressure on financial institutions and facilitate risk-taking.
</p>
<p>
Valuation sensitivity to monetary conditions may be influenced by this shift, potentially providing a more supportive environment for risk assets. The absence of active tightening from real rates, coupled with expanding liquidity, suggests that the monetary transmission mechanism could be increasingly favorable for risk-on asset classes, although specific asset performance remains subject to various other macroeconomic and idiosyncratic factors.
