<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overall US monetary regime is currently characterised by an Expansion in the Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite, indicating net easing conditions as of December 2025. This expansion is driven by a Bullish signal from ON RRP usage, alongside a historically Bullish M2 money supply signal as of October 2025, although its contribution to the composite for later months is neutral due to missing data. Conversely, Fed Assets and Reserve Balances continue to exert a Bearish influence, reflecting ongoing tightening measures. Real interest rates remain in a Neutral regime, suggesting a balanced monetary policy stance without extreme restrictiveness or accommodation. SOFR positioning signals indicate an unwind from prior speculative extremes, with both the 3-month and 5-year SOFR futures showing no clear reversal risks or extreme positioning. The lack of extreme positioning in SOFR futures, combined with a neutral real-rate regime, suggests that near-term policy expectations are not under significant pressure for an immediate shift.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fed liquidity condition: Expansion</li>
  <li>M2 regime: Bullish (October 2025), Neutral (November-December 2025 in composite)</li>
  <li>Real-rate regime: Neutral</li>
  <li>SOFR positioning tone: Unwinding from prior extremes, currently neutral policy expectations</li>
  <li>Overall monetary tone: Net supportive due to liquidity expansion, but balanced by ongoing QT and neutral real rates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Federal Reserve Liquidity Dynamics</h3>
<p>The Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite shifted to an Expansion regime in November 2025, reaching a value of 1.66 by December 2025, an increase from 0.63 in October 2025. This composite is derived from a z-score blend of M2 Money Stock, Federal Reserve total assets (WALCL), reserve balances (WRESBAL), and inverted overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) usage <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Liquidity_Composite.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Liquidity_Composite.html]</a>. The ON RRP component has consistently provided a Bullish signal, with its inverted year-over-year change at 99.823% in December 2025, indicating significant easing as usage declines <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Liquidity_Composite.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Liquidity_Composite.html]</a>. This easing impulse is countered by persistent Bearish signals from Fed Assets, with a year-over-year change of -5.03% in December 2025, and Reserve Balances, which showed a -9.70% year-over-year change, reflecting ongoing quantitative tightening <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Liquidity_Composite.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Liquidity_Composite.html]</a>. The M2 component contributed a Neutral signal to the composite in November and December 2025 due to missing data in the composite calculation, although M2 itself was Bullish in October.</p>

<h3>2. Money Supply (M2)</h3>
<p>The M2 money supply signal was classified as Bullish as of October 2025, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.65% and a 3-month momentum of 1.22% <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/M2_Money_Supply.html" target="_blank">[Source: m_2_money_supply.html]</a>. This Bullish classification is triggered by the 3-month change exceeding the 1.0% acceleration threshold <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/M2_Money_Supply.html" target="_blank">[Source: m_2_money_supply.html]</a>. While the M2 signal itself indicated expansion in October, the Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite table shows the M2 component as Neutral for November and December 2025 within the composite calculation, primarily due to the absence of updated raw M2 data for those months <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Liquidity_Composite.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Liquidity_Composite.html]</a>. This suggests that while underlying M2 dynamics were supportive, the most recent contribution to the broader liquidity composite reflects data limitations rather than a fundamental shift in M2 momentum.</p>

<h3>3. Real Interest Rates &amp; Policy Expectations</h3>
<p>The US 10-year real yield (DFII10) is currently in a Neutral regime as of December 2025, with the real yield at 1.85% tracking closely to its 6-month moving average trend of 1.86% <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Real_Interest_Rate_Trend.html" target="_blank">[Source: Real_Interest_Rate_Trend_Signal.html]</a>. This Neutral classification is maintained when the real yield remains within ±0.05% of its trend, indicating that monetary conditions are neither exceptionally restrictive nor accommodative based on this metric <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Real_Interest_Rate_Trend.html" target="_blank">[Source: Real_Interest_Rate_Trend_Signal.html]</a>. This follows a period of "Bearish" real rates which concluded in March 2025, suggesting a shift from a tightening stance to a more balanced environment.</p>
<p>In the short-end, SOFR 3-month futures positioning indicates an unwind from previous extreme positions. In mid-September 2025, speculative net short z-scores exceeded 2.36, coupled with hedger net long z-scores below -2.35, signaling a notable divergence <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/SOF_3M_CoT_Signals.html" target="_blank">[Source: SOF_3M_CoT_Signals.html]</a>. However, by November 2025, speculative net short positioning had decreased significantly to -5.10% of Open Interest, with z-scores near zero (0.0454 for speculators, -0.0258 for hedgers) <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/SOF_3M_CoT_Signals.html" target="_blank">[Source: SOF_3M_CoT_Signals.html]</a>. The 4-week flow consistently shows "Long_Reduction," with no active tactical reversal setup or extreme positioning flags. Similarly, for SOFR 5-year futures as of November 2025, speculative net positioning is -3.00% OI with a z-score of -0.4781, while hedgers are net long at 3.10% OI with a z-score of 0.4801 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/SOF_5Y_CoT_Signals.html" target="_blank">[Source: SOF_5Y_CoT_Signals.html]</a>. Significant "Long_Reduction" flow (-20.00% over four weeks) is observed, but no crowding, squeeze, or exhaustion risk flags are active <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/SOF_5Y_CoT_Signals.html" target="_blank">[Source: SOF_5Y_CoT_Signals.html]</a>. Both SOFR segments reflect a normal market structure without clear reversal regimes, aligning with the neutral stance from real interest rates.</p>

<h3>4. Synthesised Monetary Regime</h3>
<p>The synthesised monetary regime is best classified as "Liquidity Expansion with Neutral Real Rates and Unwinding Policy Expectations." The Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite is in an Expansion phase, primarily driven by the reduction in ON RRP usage. This easing dynamic is partially offset by the continued tightening signaled by Fed Assets and Reserve Balances, indicating a nuanced quantitative tightening process. M2 money supply, despite recent data gaps in the composite, shows underlying bullish momentum. Real interest rates are in a neutral state, suggesting policy is not overtly restrictive or accommodative. SOFR futures positioning for both 3-month and 5-year tenors indicates an unwinding from prior speculative extremes, with no immediate signs of crowding or reversal risk, implying relatively stable policy expectations in the near to medium term. The overall stance is predominantly supportive due to system-wide liquidity factors, but with underlying elements of continued monetary contraction and a balanced real policy setting.</p>

<h3>5. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Easing / Supportive Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Persistently positive liquidity impulse (e.g., slower QT, stabilising reserves)</li>
  <li>Stabilising or falling real yields from restrictive levels</li>
  <li>Continuation or re-acceleration in M2 growth</li>
  <li>SOFR positioning shifting towards a more accommodative policy path</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tightening / Reversal Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Renewed increase in real yields above trend</li>
  <li>Reversal in ON RRP dynamics or renewed liquidity drain</li>
  <li>Deceleration or renewed contraction in money growth</li>
  <li>SOFR positioning moving towards more persistent tightness or reduced cut expectations</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>A monetary regime characterized by expanding liquidity, neutral real rates, and unwinding policy expectations typically suggests funding conditions are becoming more accessible. The expansion in the Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite can contribute to lower liquidity premia across markets, potentially easing access to capital for various entities. In such an environment, the valuation sensitivity of interest rates, credit, and risk assets generally responds positively to improved liquidity. While the neutral real-rate stance implies that the cost of capital is not excessively burdensome, the unwinding of speculative positions in SOFR futures indicates that the market has processed and adjusted to recent policy shifts, reducing the likelihood of abrupt price movements driven by policy expectation re-pricing. This configuration can support risk assets, as a stable and improving liquidity backdrop, coupled with balanced real rates, typically reduces the discount rate for future cash flows.</p>
