<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overall US inflation signal indicates a current regime of <strong>COOL (disinflation/deflation risk)</strong> as of November 2025. This assessment reflects a significant shift from previous periods of neutral or rising inflationary pressures, suggesting an environment of below-trend inflation. Realised inflation measures (CPI, PCE) are in Neutral regimes, while market-implied expectations remain Stable, indicating a nuanced disinflationary environment with expectations currently anchored.</p>
<p>While various components exhibit differing speeds of adjustment, the composite suggests a prevailing disinflationary bias. This contrasts with earlier periods and implies a reduced risk of immediate re-acceleration.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Realised inflation (CPI, PCE) is currently in a Neutral regime, trending below historical medians but not yet signalling extreme disinflation.</li>
  <li>Market-implied inflation expectations are Stable overall, yet exhibit negative short-term momentum.</li>
  <li>The inflation term structure is Neutral, reflecting below-median expectations across various tenors and a slightly inverted breakeven curve.</li>
  <li>Wage growth and labour tightness signals are in a Neutral regime, indicating easing but not yet sharply disinflationary cost-push pressures.</li>
  <li>There is a tension between the overall "COOL" composite and the "Neutral" or "Stable" regimes of its underlying components, suggesting potential for either further cooling or stabilisation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Realised Inflation: CPI–PPI Dynamics</h3>
<p>As of October 2025, the CPI YoY stands at 2.79%, while the PPI YoY is at 3.66%. The divergence, measured as PPI minus CPI YoY, is 0.87%, resulting in a robust z-score of 0.23. This places the CPI-PPI divergence signal in a <strong>NEUTRAL</strong> regime.</p>
<p>The positive PPI-CPI spread indicates some degree of cost-push pressure at the producer level. However, the neutral z-score suggests this pressure is not extreme by historical standards and has not fully translated into a significant acceleration of consumer prices beyond historical norms for a hotter regime, nor does it indicate broad cost relief.</p>
<p>Historically, a HOT regime for this signal has been associated with more pronounced positive divergence z-scores, while a COOL regime reflected significant negative divergence, indicating disinflationary cost relief or margin compression for producers.</p>

<h3>2. Policy-Relevant Inflation: PCE &amp; Core PCE</h3>
<p>For August 2025, the PCE Price Index registered a 2.74% YoY increase, with Core PCE (excluding food and energy) at 2.91% YoY. The composite signal for policy-relevant inflation is -0.321531, classifying it in a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime.</p>
<p>Both headline and core PCE inflation rates are trending below 3%, aligning with an environment of moderate inflation pressure that does not indicate a significant acceleration or deceleration beyond historical norms. The negative composite z-score suggests inflation is below its long-term robust median, indicating a disinflationary bias within the neutral range.</p>
<p>These readings are within the range generally considered by the central bank to be consistent with a data-dependent policy stance, rather than signaling an urgent need for tightening (Hot) or easing (Cool).</p>

<h3>3. Market-Implied Inflation Expectations</h3>
<p>As of November 2025, the Market-Implied Inflation Expectations (MIIE) composite z-score is 0.034273, placing it in a <strong>STABLE</strong> regime. The 5-year forward inflation expectation rate (T5YIE) is 2.29%, and the 10-year breakeven inflation rate (T10YIE) is 2.23%.</p>
<p>While overall expectations are stable, the 3-month annualised changes for both 10-year breakevens (-1.094457 z-score) and 5-year forward expectations (-0.820327 z-score) show significant negative momentum. This suggests a notable downside stretch in the short-term trajectory of market pricing for inflation.</p>
<p>Market pricing remains broadly anchored around levels consistent with the central bank's target (assuming a 2% target, though the methodology does not specify a target). The negative momentum components indicate that while levels are stable, the recent trend in expectations leans towards disinflationary pressures.</p>

<h3>4. Term-Structure of Inflation</h3>
<p>The Inflation Term-Structure Composite is -0.315806 as of November 2025, resulting in a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime classification. The z-scores for 5-year breakevens (-0.357561) and 10-year breakevens (-0.486518) are both negative, indicating below-median inflation expectations across the intermediate and longer ends of the curve.</p>
<p>The term spread between 10-year and 5-year breakevens is slightly negative at -0.06%, suggesting that market participants do not anticipate a significant steepening of inflation expectations. The inverted 10-year real yield also exhibits a negative z-score (-0.089421), implying slightly tighter financial conditions from a real yield perspective relative to its historical median.</p>
<p>The neutral regime for the term structure is consistent with a market not pricing in extreme reflationary or disinflationary scenarios over the medium term, but with a slight bias towards below-median expectations.</p>

<h3>5. Wage Growth, Labour Tightness &amp; Cost-Push Pressures</h3>
<p>As of August 2025, the smoothed z-score for the Wage Growth & Inflation Composite (integrating wage pressure and labour market tightness) is -0.526283, classifying it in a <strong>NEUTRAL</strong> regime. While the Wage Pressure signal itself (based on ECI) entered a COOL regime in early 2025 (e.g., -1.16 z-score in January 2025), it has since reverted to a less extreme negative position (-0.705149 z-score as of April 2025), which is within its own Neutral bounds.</p>
<p>Labour market tightness also shows negative z-scores (-0.449661 as of August 2025), indicating some normalisation or easing in the tightness of the labour market. The composite reflects that while wage growth is decelerating, the combined effect of wage and labour dynamics, along with the smoothing applied, positions overall labour cost-push pressures as neutral rather than overtly disinflationary.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesis: US Inflation Regime Assessment</h3>
<p>The overarching US Inflation Signal, incorporating various price and expectation metrics, is in a <strong>COOL (disinflation/deflation risk)</strong> regime as of November 2025, with a z-score of -0.014876. This signifies a broad environment where disinflationary forces are present, pointing to below-trend inflation pressures.</p>
<p>This "COOL" composite regime exists alongside several underlying components, such as realised CPI and PCE inflation, market-implied inflation expectations, and the inflation term structure, all primarily in "Neutral" or "Stable" regimes. This highlights a nuanced situation where core inflation measures and market expectations are anchored and not yet signalling extreme disinflation, even as the broader composite suggests persistent disinflationary momentum. Wage and labour dynamics also point to easing cost-push pressures, further aligning with the disinflationary narrative.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>
<h4>Upside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A reversal in the negative momentum observed in market-implied inflation expectations could signal renewed pricing of future inflation.</li>
  <li>Persistent positive PPI-CPI divergence could eventually transmit stronger cost-push pressures to consumer prices.</li>
  <li>Unexpected resilience in demand not captured by current indicators, leading to renewed price pressures.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Downside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Continued strengthening of the overall "COOL" signal indicates an enduring disinflationary trend or potential for deflationary pressures.</li>
  <li>Further deceleration in wage growth and continued normalisation of labour market tightness would ease labour-cost pressures.</li>
  <li>A shift of market-implied expectations into a "FALLING" regime would reinforce the disinflationary outlook.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>An inflation regime characterised by a "COOL" signal and neutral-to-stable underlying components generally implies an environment conducive to declining long-term interest rates, as disinflationary pressures reduce the inflation premium. This can be supportive for duration-sensitive assets such as high-quality fixed income, potentially leading to capital appreciation in government bonds and investment-grade credit.</p>
<p>For equities, this regime can be mixed: disinflation may ease pressure on corporate margins by reducing input costs, but if it stems from weakening demand, it could signal slower earnings growth. Growth-oriented equities may find support from lower discount rates, while inflation-sensitive real assets and commodities may experience reduced demand as inflation hedging becomes less critical. Risk appetite may be tempered by concerns regarding underlying economic growth that contributes to disinflation.</p></div></section>
