<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overall US inflation environment is currently characterised by a broad "COOL" regime, as indicated by the comprehensive Fed Inflation Signal, suggesting easing inflationary pressures. However, underlying components reveal a more nuanced picture of stabilising market expectations and persistent, albeit moderating, cost-push dynamics within a neutral range. Market-implied inflation expectations remain "STABLE," while policy-relevant PCE inflation is in a "Neutral" regime, with year-over-year figures trending below historical medians.</p>
<p>Producer-level pressures show signs of building, with the CPI-PPI divergence signalling a "NEUTRAL" regime but with positive momentum. Wage growth and labour market tightness also indicate a "NEUTRAL" regime, suggesting a normalising rather than rapidly disinflationary labour market. The term structure of inflation is "Neutral," with persistently higher real yields.</p>

</ul>

<h3>1. Realised Inflation: CPI–PPI Dynamics</h3>
<p>The CPI vs PPI Divergence signal is currently in a "NEUTRAL" regime, as of November 2025. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/CPI_PPI_Divergence.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_CPI_vs_PPI_Divergence_Inflation]</a> At this time, PPI Year-on-Year growth stood at 3.61%, exceeding CPI Year-on-Year growth of 2.50%, resulting in a positive divergence of 1.10%. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/CPI_PPI_Divergence.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_CPI_vs_PPI_Divergence_Inflation]</a></p>
<p>The divergence z-score of 0.25 confirms this "NEUTRAL" classification. A 3-month change in PPI minus CPI YoY of 1.44 indicates a building inflationary pressure originating from the producer side, suggesting that cost-push dynamics are at play and potentially transmitting into consumer prices, although not yet at levels to trigger a "HOT" regime. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/CPI_PPI_Divergence.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_CPI_vs_PPI_Divergence_Inflation]</a> This divergence is not historically extreme but reflects a shift towards increased upstream pressure.</p>

<h3>2. Policy-Relevant Inflation: PCE &amp; Core PCE</h3>
<p>Policy-relevant inflation, measured by the PCE Composite, remains in a "Neutral" regime through September 2025. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Policy_Relevant_Inflation_PCE.html" target="_blank">[Source: policy_relevant_inflation_pce_methodology]</a> Headline PCE Year-on-Year was 2.79%, while Core PCE Year-on-Year was 2.83% as of September 2025. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Policy_Relevant_Inflation_PCE.html" target="_blank">[Source: policy_relevant_inflation_pce_methodology]</a></p>
<p>Both headline and core PCE z-scores are consistently negative, indicating that current inflation readings are below their historical median relative to the composite's calculation. This suggests a moderation in policy-relevant inflation pressure. The composite z-scores, ranging from -0.578 to -0.297, are well within the "Neutral" thresholds of ±0.75, implying that inflation is near the central bank's target without exhibiting strong "Hot" or "Cool" signals. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Policy_Relevant_Inflation_PCE.html" target="_blank">[Source: policy_relevant_inflation_pce_methodology]</a></p>

<h3>3. Market-Implied Inflation Expectations</h3>
<p>Market-implied inflation expectations, as captured by the MIIE signal, are in a "STABLE" regime as of December 2025. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal.html]</a> The MIIE z-score is 0.09, well within the -0.5 to 1.0 range defining a "STABLE" regime. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal.html]</a></p>
<p>Current 5-year and 10-year implied inflation rates are 2.32% and 2.26%, respectively, suggesting expectations are anchored around the Federal Reserve's target. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal.html]</a> However, the 3-month annualised z-scores for T5YIE (-0.52) and T10YIE (-0.64) indicate decelerating momentum in inflation expectations, implying that while expectations are anchored, the short-term trend is downwards. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal.html]</a> This positions market pricing broadly consistent with disinflationary trends observed in realised inflation, but not yet signalling a "FALLING" regime.</p>

<h3>4. Term-Structure of Inflation</h3>
<p>The inflation term-structure signal remained in a "Neutral" regime throughout 2025, with the composite ranging from -0.318872 to 0.194939. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Inflation_Term_Structure.html" target="_blank">[Source: inflation_term_structure_methodology.html]</a> This indicates that the relative pricing of short-, medium-, and long-term inflation is not exhibiting extreme "Reflation" or "Disinflation" pressures according to the signal's fixed thresholds. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Inflation_Term_Structure.html" target="_blank">[Source: inflation_term_structure_methodology.html]</a></p>
<p>The inverted 10-year real yield z-score (Z_mReal) showed consistently negative values, with a low of -0.745294 in January 2025. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Inflation_Term_Structure.html" target="_blank">[Source: inflation_term_structure_methodology.html]</a> This implies persistently higher real yields, which typically signify tighter financial conditions and could act as a disinflationary force, aligning with a stable/neutral inflation outlook rather than one of re-acceleration risk. The moderate negative values for 5-year and 10-year breakeven z-scores by year-end further support a neutral interpretation.</p>

<h3>5. Wage Growth, Labour Tightness &amp; Cost-Push Pressures</h3>
<p>The Wage Growth & Inflation Composite is in a "NEUTRAL" regime, reflecting stable wage inflation pressure and labour market tightness. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: wage_growth_and_inflation_methodology]</a> The Inflation Composite z-score consistently remained within the neutral range of [-1.0, +1.0] across the observed forecast period (November 2024 to October 2025). <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: wage_growth_and_inflation_methodology]</a></p>
<p>Wage Pressure z-scores were generally "NEUTRAL", with a brief "COOL" (disinflationary) phase from July 2024 to February 2025. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: wage_growth_and_inflation_methodology]</a> Concurrently, Labor Tightness z-scores moderated, moving from -0.770847 in November 2024 to -0.449661 in October 2025. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labor_Market_Turnover.html" target="_blank">[Source: Labor_Market_Turnover]</a> This collective moderation suggests that wage and labour dynamics are normalising, pointing to easing rather than accelerating cost-push inflation pressures. This is consistent with a business cycle phase of normalising growth rather than overheating or severe contraction.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesis: US Inflation Regime Assessment</h3>
<p>Synthesising the various inflation signals reveals a complex picture of ongoing disinflationary forces alongside areas of stabilization and potential future pressure. While the broad Fed Inflation Signal has shifted to "COOL," indicating a widespread easing of inflation pressure, market expectations and underlying dynamics present a more nuanced "Neutral" state. Market-implied expectations remain anchored but show decelerating momentum, and policy-relevant PCE inflation is consistently below its historical median.</p>
<p>Producer price pressures, as indicated by the CPI-PPI divergence, are building, suggesting potential future stickiness, while wage growth and labour market tightness have moved from disinflationary to a neutral, stabilising phase. The term structure of inflation is also neutral, with higher real yields dampening long-term expectations. This suggests a regime best described as "Normalising Disinflation with Anchored Expectations," where broad disinflationary trends are present, but core components are not signalling outright deflationary risk, and some cost-push elements persist.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>
<h4>Upside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Renewed energy or commodity price shocks could swiftly reintroduce pipeline pressures, given the current building producer-side inflation indicated by the CPI-PPI divergence. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/CPI_PPI_Divergence.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_CPI_vs_PPI_Divergence_Inflation]</a></li>
  <li>If the deceleration in market-implied inflation expectations reverses, and they begin to signal "RISING" trends, it could lead to higher realised inflation, especially if wage growth stabilises at an elevated level. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal.html]</a></li>
  <li>A re-tightening of the labour market or an acceleration in wage growth from its current neutral state could reignite service-sector inflation and broader cost-push pressures. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: wage_growth_and_inflation_methodology]</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Downside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A sustained "COOL" regime in the broad Fed Inflation Signal suggests further disinflationary momentum, which could push overall inflation below central bank targets if other components follow. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: fed_inflation_signal]</a></li>
  <li>A deeper decline in the 3-month annualised momentum of market-implied inflation expectations, leading to a "FALLING" regime, could signal persistent disinflationary pressures. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal.html]</a></li>
  <li>A continued environment of persistently higher real yields, as indicated by the inflation term-structure, could suppress aggregate demand and further moderate inflation. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Inflation_Term_Structure.html" target="_blank">[Source: inflation_term_structure_methodology.html]</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>An environment of normalising disinflation with anchored expectations typically implies a less volatile inflation trajectory compared to periods of accelerating or rapidly decelerating inflation. This scenario tends to be generally favourable for fixed income, as interest rates may stabilise or decline moderately in line with easing inflation, improving duration sensitivity. For equities, a stable disinflationary backdrop can support valuations, particularly for growth-oriented sectors, as financing costs moderate and real earnings power improves. Real assets and inflation hedges may see reduced demand compared to periods of high or rising inflation, but retain a role for diversification against unexpected shocks.</p>
<p>Risk appetite may remain robust in such a regime, as the absence of extreme inflation scenarios reduces policy uncertainty. However, the presence of building producer-side pressures suggests that while inflation is moderating, it may not fall precipitously, keeping a floor under certain price dynamics and preventing outright deflationary concerns from dominating market sentiment.</p>

<h4>Upside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Renewed energy or commodity price shocks could swiftly reintroduce pipeline pressures, given the current building producer-side inflation indicated by the CPI-PPI divergence. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/CPI_PPI_Divergence.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_CPI_vs_PPI_Divergence_Inflation]</a></li>
  <li>If the deceleration in market-implied inflation expectations reverses, and they begin to signal "RISING" trends, it could lead to higher realised inflation, especially if wage growth stabilises at an elevated level. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal.html]</a></li>
  <li>A re-tightening of the labour market or an acceleration in wage growth from its current neutral state could reignite service-sector inflation and broader cost-push pressures. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: wage_growth_and_inflation_methodology]</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Downside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A sustained "COOL" regime in the broad Fed Inflation Signal suggests further disinflationary momentum, which could push overall inflation below central bank targets if other components follow. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: fed_inflation_signal]</a></li>
  <li>A deeper decline in the 3-month annualised momentum of market-implied inflation expectations, leading to a "FALLING" regime, could signal persistent disinflationary pressures. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal.html]</a></li>
  <li>A continued environment of persistently higher real yields, as indicated by the inflation term-structure, could suppress aggregate demand and further moderate inflation. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Inflation_Term_Structure.html" target="_blank">[Source: inflation_term_structure_methodology.html]</a></li>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>An environment of normalising disinflation with anchored expectations typically implies a less volatile inflation trajectory compared to periods of accelerating or rapidly decelerating inflation. This scenario tends to be generally favourable for fixed income, as interest rates may stabilise or decline moderately in line with easing inflation, improving duration sensitivity. For equities, a stable disinflationary backdrop can support valuations, particularly for growth-oriented sectors, as financing costs moderate and real earnings power improves. Real assets and inflation hedges may see reduced demand compared to periods of high or rising inflation, but retain a role for diversification against unexpected shocks.</p>
<p>Risk appetite may remain robust in such a regime, as the absence of extreme inflation scenarios reduces policy uncertainty. However, the presence of building producer-side pressures suggests that while inflation is moderating, it may not fall precipitously, keeping a floor under certain price dynamics and preventing outright deflationary concerns from dominating market sentiment.</p>
