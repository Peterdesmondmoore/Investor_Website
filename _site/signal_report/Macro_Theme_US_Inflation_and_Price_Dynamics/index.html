<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overall US inflation landscape presents a mixed but predominantly neutral to disinflationary picture, with market expectations remaining stable. The Fed Inflation Signal indicates a "COOL" regime, suggesting disinflation/deflation risk, although its latest z-score technically falls within the "NEUTRAL" range based on its defined thresholds. Realised inflation, as measured by CPI-PPI dynamics and policy-relevant PCE, largely sits within neutral territory, with some evidence of mild cost-push pressures.</p>
<p>Market-implied inflation expectations are anchored in a "STABLE" regime, reflecting a lack of extreme bullish or bearish sentiment. Wage growth and labor market tightness signals, after showing disinflationary trends earlier in the year, have settled into a "NEUTRAL" state, implying easing cost-push pressures without significant acceleration.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Realised inflation (CPI/PPI, PCE) largely in a neutral regime, with CPI showing a mild cost-push from producers.</li>
  <li>Inflation expectations (market-implied, term-structure) are stable and anchored.</li>
  <li>Wage and labour dynamics indicate easing cost-push pressures, currently in a neutral regime.</li>
  <li>A notable divergence exists between the Fed Inflation Signal's explicit "COOL" regime label and its z-score, which technically falls within "NEUTRAL".</li>
  <li>The overall inflation risk bias is balanced, with disinflationary momentum offset by some underlying price pressures and a neutral policy-relevant PCE outlook.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Realised Inflation: CPI–PPI Dynamics</h3>
<p>As of November 30, 2025, the CPI-PPI Divergence signal indicates a "NEUTRAL" regime. The CPI Year-over-Year (YoY) stands at 2.50%, while the PPI YoY is higher at 3.61%. This results in a positive PPI-minus-CPI YoY divergence of 1.10%, with a robust z-score of 0.254704. This marks a shift, as the divergence remained negative from January 2023 to July 2025. The current positive divergence suggests mild cost-push pressure where producer prices are rising faster than consumer prices, which could eventually transmit to consumer prices, but it is not currently at an extreme level to trigger a "HOT" signal.</p>
<p>Historically, the market experienced a "HOT" inflation pressure regime from February 2021 to July 2022, characterized by a peak divergence z-score of 3.38 in May 2021. Conversely, a "COOL" disinflationary period was observed from April 2023 to September 2023, with the divergence z-score bottoming at -2.47 in June 2023. The current neutral position suggests a more balanced pass-through dynamic without extreme pipeline pressures or relief. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/CPI_PPI_Divergence.html" target="_blank">[Source: CPI_PPI_Divergence]</a></p>

<h3>2. Policy-Relevant Inflation: PCE &amp; Core PCE</h3>
<p>The Policy-Relevant Inflation (PCE) composite remained in a "Neutral" regime through September 2025. Headline PCE Year-over-Year (YoY) was 2.79% and Core PCE YoY was 2.83% in September 2025. The PCE Composite z-score was -0.335789, consistently staying within the methodology's |C<sub>t</sub>| ≤ 0.75 threshold for a "Neutral" regime. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Policy_Relevant_Inflation_PCE.html" target="_blank">[Source: policy_relevant_inflation_pce.html]</a></p>
<p>These readings sit above the central bank's stated 2% inflation target, but the "Neutral" regime indicates that inflation pressure is not deemed "Hot" or "Cool" relative to its historical distribution. This suggests that while inflation remains above target, it is not exhibiting extreme acceleratory or deceleratory dynamics from a policy-relevant perspective. It is noted that the provided data table represents a forecast rather than confirmed historical readings. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Policy_Relevant_Inflation_PCE.html" target="_blank">[Source: policy_relevant_inflation_pce.html]</a></p>

<h3>3. Market-Implied Inflation Expectations</h3>
<p>Market-implied inflation expectations were in a "STABLE" regime as of December 31, 2025. The 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate (T5YIE) stood at 2.32%, and the 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T10YIE) was 2.26%. The Market-Implied Inflation Expectations (MIIE) composite z-score was 0.087041, which is firmly within the -0.5 to 1.0 range defining a "STABLE" regime. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal]</a></p>
<p>This "STABLE" classification indicates that market participants' expectations for future inflation are well-anchored and not signaling renewed inflation risk or significant disinflationary trends. However, component z-scores for both YoY and 3-month annualised changes in T5YIE and T10YIE were negative, suggesting mild disinflationary momentum in the near-term expectations. This implies that while expectations are stable in level, the rate of change is leaning towards disinflation. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal]</a></p>

<h3>4. Term-Structure of Inflation</h3>
<p>The Inflation Term-Structure signal was in a "Neutral" regime as of December 31, 2025, with its composite registering -0.262581. This indicates that the relative pricing of short-, medium-, and long-term inflation is not exhibiting extreme "Reflation" or "Disinflation" characteristics. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Inflation_Term_Structure.html" target="_blank">[Source: inflation_term_structure]</a></p>
<p>The individual robust z-scores for the 5-Year Breakeven (Z_T5), 10-Year Breakeven (Z_T10), and the inverted 10-Year TIPS yield (Z_mReal) were all negative (-0.266465, -0.378661, and -0.141322, respectively). This suggests that inflation expectations across these horizons are currently below their historical median, and real yields are above their median, which aligns with a general disinflationary tilt within the neutral regime. The term structure is not strongly consistent with either a re-acceleration or an extreme soft landing narrative, reflecting a balanced, albeit modestly disinflationary, outlook from the rates market. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Inflation_Term_Structure.html" target="_blank">[Source: inflation_term_structure]</a></p>

<h3>5. Wage Growth, Labour Tightness &amp; Cost-Push Pressures</h3>
<p>As of October 1, 2025, the Wage Growth & Inflation Composite signal registered a "NEUTRAL" regime. The Inflation Composite z-score was -0.546746, with its underlying Wage Pressure z-score at -0.357684 and Labor Market Tightness z-score at -0.735808. This suggests that wage and labor market dynamics are currently not exerting extreme cost-push inflation pressures. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: wage_growth_and_inflation.html]</a></p>
<p>Earlier in 2025, specifically in January, the Wage Pressure signal had indicated a "COOL" (disinflationary) regime with a z-score of -1.162677. This prior period of cooling wage growth has since normalized, bringing the composite back into neutral territory. The current state implies that the labor market is normalising from prior tightness, with wage growth moderating and consequently easing potential cost-push inflation. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: wage_growth_and_inflation.html]</a></p>

<h3>6. Synthesis: US Inflation Regime Assessment</h3>
<p>The collective signals suggest a US inflation regime characterized by underlying disinflationary momentum and anchored market expectations, despite policy-relevant inflation still being above target. Realised inflation measures (CPI-PPI, PCE) largely fall into neutral regimes, with a subtle indication of producer price pressures that have not yet translated significantly into consumer prices. Market-implied expectations and the inflation term structure reinforce a stable and neutral outlook, with some negative z-scores suggesting a disinflationary tilt. Wage growth, having cooled earlier in the year, is now in a neutral state, reducing immediate cost-push concerns.</p>
<p>The overarching regime can be best described as a "Neutral with Disinflationary Bias and Anchored Expectations". The Fed's broad inflation signal indicating "COOL" (with a z-score near neutral) suggests a cautious stance towards disinflation/deflation risk, but this is not fully echoed by other composite z-scores which remain in the neutral range.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>
<h4>Upside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The positive divergence between PPI and CPI, while currently neutral, could signal future cost-push transmission if producer price increases persist or accelerate. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/CPI_PPI_Divergence.html" target="_blank">[Source: CPI_PPI_Divergence]</a></li>
  <li>Policy-relevant PCE remains above the central bank's 2% target, indicating a structural inflation level that could prove sticky. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Policy_Relevant_Inflation_PCE.html" target="_blank">[Source: policy_relevant_inflation_pce.html]</a></li>
  <li>A potential re-tightening of the labor market could reverse the current normalisation in wage pressures, leading to renewed cost-push inflation. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: wage_growth_and_inflation.html]</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The Fed Inflation Signal's "COOL" regime (even with z-score near neutral) suggests underlying disinflationary forces or deflation risk. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: fed_inflation_signal]</a></li>
  <li>Negative z-scores for YoY and 3-month annualised changes in market-implied inflation expectations suggest a deceleration in forward inflation momentum. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal]</a></li>
  <li>The consistent "Neutral" regime of the inflation term-structure, coupled with negative component z-scores, implies sustained below-median inflation expectations and above-median real yields. <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Inflation_Term_Structure.html" target="_blank">[Source: inflation_term_structure]</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>An inflation regime characterized by a disinflationary bias within an overall neutral environment, coupled with anchored market expectations, typically has several broad implications for asset classes. In such a state, fixed income assets may experience stable to modestly rising prices, especially if real yields remain elevated and nominal yields are not pressured higher by accelerating inflation. Credit markets may perform well as default risks remain contained in a non-inflationary growth environment.</p>
<p>Equities might find support from lower discount rates, though sector performance could diverge, favoring growth-oriented companies over value or cyclical names sensitive to inflation. Real assets and traditional inflation hedges, such as commodities, might experience headwinds due to reduced inflation premiums, unless driven by specific supply-demand imbalances. Risk appetite generally remains stable, with less demand for inflation-protection strategies and a focus on duration management in fixed income portfolios.</p>
