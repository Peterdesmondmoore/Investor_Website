<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The US inflation landscape is characterised by a continued disinflationary trajectory in broader price dynamics, with the composite Fed Inflation Signal indicating a "COOL" regime. Policy-relevant inflation measures and market-implied expectations remain in "Neutral" or "Stable" regimes, yet their underlying quantitative signals exhibit a persistent downside bias. Wage growth and labour market tightness continue to normalise, further alleviating cost-push pressures.</p>
<p>This environment is consistent with central bank efforts to achieve price stability, with the risk of re-acceleration currently contained by broad disinflationary forces. Market participants appear to be pricing in a sustained period of moderate inflation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Realised inflation (Fed Composite) indicates a "COOL" regime, signalling a clear disinflationary trend.</li>
  <li>Policy-relevant inflation (PCE & Core PCE) is "Neutral," with headline and core measures moderating from recent highs.</li>
  <li>Market-implied inflation expectations are "STABLE" or "Neutral," showing anchored but slightly negative-leaning short-to-medium-term expectations.</li>
  <li>Wage and labour tightness indicators reflect easing cost-push pressures, moving towards disinflationary conditions.</li>
  <li>Overall inflation risk bias is to the downside, with contained re-acceleration risks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Realised Inflation: CPI–PPI Dynamics</h3>
<p>As of October 31, 2025, the Producer Price Index (PPI_YoY) recorded 3.66%, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI_YoY) stood at 2.79%. The PPI-CPI year-on-year divergence was 0.87%, with a robust z-score of 0.23. This places the CPI vs PPI signal in a "NEUTRAL" regime.</p>
<p>The positive divergence suggests some upstream cost pressures at the producer level. However, the modest z-score indicates this divergence is not historically extreme and does not currently signal aggressive cost-push inflation likely to rapidly feed into consumer prices. The signal has maintained a "NEUTRAL" regime since January 2024, indicating a period of balanced, non-extreme pressure.</p>

<h3>2. Policy-Relevant Inflation: PCE &amp; Core PCE</h3>
<p>For August 31, 2025, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) YoY stood at 2.74%, and Core PCE YoY was 2.91%. The PCE Composite, which blends these measures, registered a value of -0.321531, classifying it in a "Neutral" regime.</p>
<p>While both headline and core PCE measures remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, their robust z-scores and the composite signal indicate that inflation pressure is near trend but with a leaning towards the "Cool" side of neutral relative to historical patterns. This composite has been consistently in a "Neutral" regime since September 2024, albeit showing a slight re-acceleration from an April 2025 low, consistent with a data-dependent policy stance.</p>

<h3>3. Market-Implied Inflation Expectations</h3>
<p>As of November 30, 2025, 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate (T5YIE) was 2.29%, and the 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T10YIE) was 2.23%. The Market-Implied Inflation Expectations (MIIE) composite registered a z-score of 0.034, falling within a "STABLE" regime.</p>
<p>Market pricing indicates that inflation expectations are well-anchored and stable in the medium to long term, remaining below the peaks observed in early 2022. The composite's position near the neutral point suggests an absence of strong directional bias, aligning with a belief in continued disinflation or stable, moderate inflation. This "STABLE" regime has been sustained since June 2022.</p>

<h3>4. Term-Structure of Inflation</h3>
<p>The inflation term-structure, as of November 30, 2025, shows T5YIE at 2.29%, T10YIE at 2.23%, and the 10-Year TIPS real yield (DFII10) at 1.77%. The term spread (T10YIE - T5YIE) is slightly inverted at -0.06%. The Inflation Term-Structure Composite registered -0.315806, placing it in a "Neutral" regime.</p>
<p>The slightly inverted breakeven curve indicates a degree of market caution regarding longer-term inflation pressures relative to the short term. The composite's "Neutral" regime, with its negative value, suggests an environment without strong reflationary forces, leaning towards disinflationary pressures. This is consistent with a soft landing scenario rather than re-acceleration or stagnation driven by inflation.</p>

<h3>5. Wage Growth, Labour Tightness &amp; Cost-Push Pressures</h3>
<p>For August 1, 2025, the Wage Pressure z-score was -0.705, and the Labor Market Tightness z-score was -0.449. The overall Inflation Composite (integrating ECI and LMT) stood at -0.577, in a "NEUTRAL" regime. Notably, wage growth (ECI YoY) for private and civilian workers softened from 4.1-4.2% in June 2024 to 3.5-3.6% by April 2025.</p>
<p>These dynamics indicate a continued normalisation of the labour market and easing wage-driven cost-push inflation. The persistently negative z-scores for wage pressure and labour tightness, with wage pressure briefly entering "COOL" territory in early 2025, suggest falling inflationary impulses from the labour sector.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesis: US Inflation Regime Assessment</h3>
<p>The aggregate US inflation regime can be characterised as a "Disinflationary Trajectory with Anchored but Downside-Leaning Expectations." While the broader Fed Inflation Signal is in a "COOL" regime, policy-relevant measures (PCE), market expectations (MIIE), and the inflation term structure are in "Neutral" or "Stable" regimes. However, the quantitative values underlying these neutral classifications often exhibit a negative bias, indicating subdued inflationary pressures. Wage growth and labour market tightness are consistently easing, contributing to this disinflationary narrative.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>
<h4>Upside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A re-acceleration in global commodity prices, particularly energy, could reignite pipeline pressures, as suggested by the current PPI-CPI divergence.</li>
  <li>Persistent stickiness in services inflation, driven by factors not fully captured by labour market normalisation.</li>
  <li>Unexpectedly strong consumer demand or a resurgence of fiscal stimulus could interrupt the disinflationary trend.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Downside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Faster-than-anticipated disinflation in shelter components of CPI and PCE.</li>
  <li>A significant weakening of global demand, leading to broader price compression across goods and services.</li>
  <li>Continued and accelerated normalisation of labour market dynamics, further dampening wage growth.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>A macroeconomic environment characterised by a disinflationary trajectory and anchored, albeit downside-leaning, market expectations typically influences asset classes as follows: fixed income assets may experience support due to reduced inflation risk premium and potentially lower long-term interest rate expectations. Credit markets may benefit from a stable rate environment, but the lean towards disinflation implies greater scrutiny of corporate earnings and solvency. Equities could favour growth-oriented sectors over value, as lower discount rates support longer-duration assets, assuming corporate earnings remain resilient. Real assets and inflation-sensitive commodities might face headwinds as direct inflation-hedging demand diminishes, though specific commodity dynamics (e.g., energy supply shocks) could still introduce volatility. This regime generally encourages a focus on quality and earnings stability across portfolios, with reduced impetus for explicit inflation-beta exposure.</p></div></section>
