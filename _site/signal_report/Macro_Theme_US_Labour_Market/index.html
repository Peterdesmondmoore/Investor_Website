  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><p><em>Employment composition, tightness, wages, hours, flows and sentiment.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The US labour market currently demonstrates a prevailing neutral regime with a distinct cooling bias across various indicators. While headline composites often register as "NEUTRAL", underlying metrics and recent momentum shifts consistently point towards increasing slack and moderating demand conditions. This environment suggests an unwind from previous tightness, although a sharp deterioration is not universally signalled.</p>
<p>There is a notable divergence between some headline neutral classifications and underlying component stress, particularly in underemployment and consumer sentiment, which indicate more pronounced headwinds. Overall labour market momentum shows signs of deceleration, and worker confidence appears to be waning.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Employment composition regime:</strong> NEUTRAL, though nearing a 'COOL' state with rising unemployment.</li>
  <li><strong>Underemployment trend and level:</strong> NEUTRAL, but with elevated underlying stress and rising U-6 momentum.</li>
  <li><strong>Tightness / turnover conditions:</strong> NEUTRAL for JOLTS tightness but trending softer; turnover differential is BEARISH.</li>
  <li><strong>Hours and momentum signals:</strong> NEUTRAL, with average weekly hours near 'COOL' thresholds and payroll momentum below median.</li>
  <li><strong>Overall labour-market bias:</strong> Still neutral but with a consistent and broad cooling bias.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Employment Composition &amp; Headline Slack</h3>
<p>The Employment Composition Signal is currently in a NEUTRAL regime as of 2025-09-01, with a z-score of -0.657. This position is notably close to the "COOL" threshold of -0.75, indicating a trend toward increasing slack within the labour market. The unemployment rate stands at 4.4%, having risen by 0.3 over the last three months, while the participation rate is 62.4% and the employment-to-population ratio is 59.7%. The rising unemployment rate is a primary driver of the observed easing in employment conditions.</p>

<h3>2. Underemployment &amp; Hidden Slack</h3>
<p>Underemployment risk remains in a NEUTRAL regime as of 2025-09-01, with a composite z-score of 0.519540. Despite this neutral classification, the raw metrics indicate elevated stress: the U-6 underutilization rate is 8.0% (up 0.3 over three months), and median weeks unemployed is 10.0. The 0-100 scaled score is 99.999999, which suggests underemployment is near its historical high within the observed range. This combination reflects significant underlying slack that could weigh on future consumption support and potentially reduce wage pressures.</p>

<h3>3. Tightness, Turnover &amp; Job Flows</h3>
<p>Labor Market Tightness, derived from JOLTS data, registered a NEUTRAL regime as of 2025-08-01, with a composite z-score of -0.370970. The quits rate stands at 1.9%, layoffs at 1.1%, and job openings at 4.3%. The underlying "Labor Tightness" (quits minus layoffs) component has a z-score of -0.449661, while the openings rate z-score is -0.252934. Both show negative 3-month momentum, indicating a trend of easing tightness in the supply-demand balance.</p>
<p>The Labor Market Turnover Differential, which gauges worker confidence via quits versus layoffs, is in a BEARISH regime as of 2025-08-01. The differential is 0.8 percentage points (1.9% quits vs. 1.1% layoffs), with a z-score of -0.8431134. This persistently negative z-score reflects declining worker confidence and a sustained loosening of labour market conditions. Job Flows data from Q4 2024 is in a NEUTRAL regime (z-score: -0.211883), improving from prior 'COOL' readings, primarily due to reduced job losses. However, Gross Job Gains remain below their historical median, suggesting a lack of robust firm-level hiring dynamism, which limits overall labour market resilience.</p>

<h3>4. Hours Worked &amp; Labour Momentum</h3>
<p>The Weekly Hours Signal is in a NEUTRAL regime as of 2025-09-01, though its composite z-score of -0.674491 is close to the "COOL" threshold. Total Private average weekly hours are 34.2, and Manufacturing hours are 39.9. Both components exhibit z-scores around -0.67, implying below-median levels of activity. Manufacturing hours, in particular, show negative 3-month momentum (-0.2), indicating firms are adjusting margins via reduced hours. The Labour Market Momentum signal, combining jobless claims and payrolls, was in a Neutral regime as of 2025-09-30 (composite z-score: -0.113112). However, nonfarm payroll momentum (3-month difference z-score of -0.495187) has been consistently below its rolling median, signalling a deceleration in hiring activity.</p>

<h3>5. Sectoral Breadth &amp; Diffusion</h3>
<p>The Sectoral Employment Diffusion Index is in a NEUTRAL regime as of 2025-09-01, with a diffusion z-score of 0.0 and 50.0% of monitored sectors exhibiting positive year-over-year growth. Leisure &amp; Hospitality shows the strongest growth at +1.39% YoY, while Manufacturing recorded the largest decline at -0.73% YoY. The median sector year-over-year growth is a marginal +0.09%, but its 3-month momentum is negative at -0.35%. This suggests that while breadth is currently balanced, the underlying trend in sectoral performance is weakening, indicating potential for concentrated rather than broad-based gains.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesised US Labour Market Regime</h3>
<p>The US labour market currently operates in a "Cooling at the Margin, but Overall Neutral" regime. While several aggregate indicators remain classified as NEUTRAL, a consistent pattern of easing conditions and declining momentum is evident across multiple pillars. The notable exception is consumer sentiment, which is explicitly "Bearish." This environment reflects a moderation in overall tightness, increasing underlying slack, and a deceleration in hiring dynamics and worker confidence, without yet signalling a severe contraction.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside / Resilience Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Stabilisation or improvement in underemployment metrics (e.g., U-6 and median weeks unemployed returning to lower levels).</li>
  <li>An acceleration in hiring momentum and a reversal of the "Bearish" turnover regime, signalling renewed worker confidence.</li>
  <li>Broadening of sectoral employment gains, particularly in interest-sensitive sectors, indicating a more resilient economic expansion.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside / Slowdown Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Underemployment metrics (especially U-6) continuing to rise or shifting into a "HOT" regime, indicating significant labour market deterioration.</li>
  <li>Further deterioration in job flows, with declining gross job gains and increasing job losses, suggesting reduced firm dynamism.</li>
  <li>Sectoral employment diffusion tipping into a "COOL" regime with broad-based weakening across industries, signalling an imminent slowdown.</li>
  <li>A sustained "Bearish" consumer sentiment leading to a more pronounced downturn in household consumption.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The synthesised labour market regime, characterized by a neutral but consistently cooling bias, implies a moderation of wage pressures. The "COOL" wage pressure signal from the inflation composite further supports this disinflationary narrative. Reduced labour market tightness and increasing slack typically translate into less upward pressure on labour costs, which can affect corporate profit margins and central bank policy considerations.</p>
<p>For household consumption, the rising underemployment and "Bearish" consumer sentiment signals suggest potential headwinds. A softening labour market generally correlates with decreased household income stability and reduced willingness to spend, impacting aggregate demand. From a macro-policy perspective, this environment could be interpreted as progress towards price stability, potentially allowing for less restrictive monetary policy if inflation continues to recede without a severe rise in unemployment, but the underlying stress in sentiment and underemployment could prompt closer monitoring for overtightening risks.</</div></section>
