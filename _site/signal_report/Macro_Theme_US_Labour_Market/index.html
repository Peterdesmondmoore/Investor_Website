  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><p><em>Employment composition, tightness, wages, hours, flows and sentiment.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The US labour market presents a nuanced and evolving state, predominantly classified as "Neutral" across several composite indicators, yet with clear signals of underlying softening and rising slack. While headline employment composition has stabilized following a recent cooling phase, underemployment risk shows an upward trend, indicating mounting hidden slack. Labor market tightness and wage pressure, within their respective "Neutral" regimes, are both exhibiting decelerating trends, coinciding with a persistent "Bearish" labor turnover differential. Weekly hours indicate stable demand with slight negative momentum, and overall labor momentum is "Neutral" with mixed claims data. Job flows and sectoral employment diffusion, while "Neutral," display decelerating dynamism and underlying weakness in growth breadth, respectively. Consumer sentiment remains deeply "Bearish," suggesting significant headwinds for demand.</p>
<p>The aggregate assessment indicates a gradual easing of labor market conditions, with increasing evidence of slack building beneath the surface, despite many headline regime classifications remaining within neutral bands.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Employment Composition:</strong> Neutral (stabilizing after recent cooling).</li>
  <li><strong>Underemployment:</strong> Neutral (risk trending higher).</li>
  <li><strong>Tightness / Turnover:</strong> Tightness: Neutral (decelerating); Turnover: Bearish (persistent weakening).</li>
  <li><strong>Hours and Momentum:</strong> Weekly Hours: Neutral (slight negative momentum); Labor Momentum: Neutral (mixed claims).</li>
  <li><strong>Sectoral Breadth:</strong> Neutral (stable breadth, but underlying softening).</li>
  <li><strong>Overall Labour-Market Bias:</strong> Gradual easing with rising slack.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Employment Composition &amp; Headline Slack</h3>
<p>The Employment Composition signal currently stands in a "NEUTRAL" regime as of September 2025, with a composite z-score of -0.657. This reflects a stabilization following "COOL (slack rising)" classifications in July and August 2025. The latest unemployment rate is 4.4%, the participation rate is 62.4%, and the employment-population ratio is 59.7%.</p>
<p>Despite the "NEUTRAL" regime, the 3-month momentum for unemployment is 0.3, indicating a recent increase in joblessness. This suggests that while headline composition may have found a floor, underlying pressures remain in flux.</p>

<h3>2. Underemployment &amp; Hidden Slack</h3>
<p>Underemployment risk remains in a "NEUTRAL" regime as of September 2025, yet the smoothed composite score of 0.535 indicates moderate stress is building and approaching the "HOT" threshold. The U-6 underutilization rate registered 8.0%, showing a 3-month momentum of +0.3, signaling an increase in broad labor market slack. Median weeks unemployed held steady at 10.0.</p>
<p>The upward trend in underemployment metrics, particularly the rising U-6 rate, suggests an accumulation of hidden slack that could translate into future demand weakness and softer wage pressure, despite the current "NEUTRAL" classification.</p>

<h3>3. Tightness, Turnover &amp; Job Flows</h3>
<p>Labor Market Tightness (JOLTS) is in a "NEUTRAL" regime as of August 2025, with a smoothed composite z-score of -0.297. This reflects a stabilization from a "COOL (easing)" regime observed in September 2024. The quits rate stands at 1.9%, layoffs at 1.1%, and job openings at 4.3%. The core "Labor Tightness" (quits minus layoffs) is 0.8.</p>
<p>However, the Labor Market Turnover Differential indicates a "Bearish" regime as of August 2025, with a differential of 0.8 percentage points and a z-score of -0.84. This regime has been persistently "Bearish" since late 2023, reflecting diminishing worker confidence relative to employer-initiated separations. Job flows data, last updated for Q4 2024, is "NEUTRAL" with a composite z-score of -0.212, but reveals decelerating dynamism, as net job creation has declined to 287.0k and the gains-to-losses ratio is 1.038.</p>

<h3>4. Hours Worked &amp; Labour Momentum</h3>
<p>The Weekly Hours signal maintains a "NEUTRAL" regime as of September 2025, with a composite level z-score of -0.675. Both Total Private (34.2 hours) and Manufacturing (39.9 hours) average weekly hours show limited directional momentum, with the 3-month change composite at -0.1. This indicates stable, but not strengthening, labor demand.</p>
<p>The broader Labour Market Momentum signal is also classified as "Neutral" as of November 2025, with a composite score of 0.139. Recent data shows a year-on-year decline of 0.04% for Initial Claims (ICSA) as of November 2025, while Continuing Claims (CCSA) rose by 4.65% year-on-year. Nonfarm payrolls data (PAYEMS 3-month difference of 187.0k) is available up to September 2025, consistent with a steady, rather than accelerating, trend.</p>

<h3>5. Sectoral Breadth &amp; Diffusion</h3>
<p>Sectoral Employment Diffusion is in a "NEUTRAL" regime as of September 2025, with the diffusion index consistently at 50.0. This indicates a balanced breadth of year-over-year job growth across the four tracked sectors (Manufacturing, Construction, Professional &amp; Business Services, Leisure &amp; Hospitality).</p>
<p>Despite the neutral breadth, the median sector year-over-year growth has cooled to 0.000925, and its 3-month momentum is notably negative at -0.003492. Manufacturing (-0.0073% YoY) and Professional &amp; Business Services (-0.0027% YoY) show negative growth, suggesting underlying softening within specific segments that could impact overall breadth if trends persist.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesised US Labour Market Regime</h3>
<p>The synthesised US labor market regime exhibits a prevailing "Neutral" character across several pillars, but with clear and consistent signals of underlying softening and increasing slack. While headline employment remains stable, indicators of labor fluidity, dynamism, and consumer confidence point towards a cooling environment.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside / Resilience Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Stabilisation in underemployment could reverse the recent upward trend in slack.</li>
  <li>Improving turnover and flows would signal renewed worker confidence and dynamism.</li>
  <li>Sectoral re-acceleration, particularly in weakening sectors, would broaden job growth.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside / Slowdown Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Underemployment composite turning “HOT” would indicate significant and mounting hidden slack.</li>
  <li>Further deterioration in job flows and the gains-to-losses ratio could signal an impending labor market contraction.</li>
  <li>Diffusion index tipping into COOL would reflect narrowing breadth and rising downside risk to overall employment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The observed easing in labor market conditions, despite several "Neutral" regime classifications, suggests a reduction in upward wage pressures. The Wage Pressure z-score of -0.705 (August 2025) within the "NEUTRAL" Inflation Composite further supports this disinflationary trend. This environment typically lessens the impetus for hawkish monetary policy, potentially supporting fixed income valuations through lower interest rate expectations.</p>
<p>For consumption and corporate earnings, the rising underemployment risk, "Bearish" consumer sentiment, and decelerating job dynamism present potential headwinds. A softening labor market may impact consumer spending power and corporate revenue growth, particularly for sectors sensitive to discretionary consumption. Policy relevance remains high, with central bank and fiscal authorities closely monitoring these evolving labor market dynamics for signs of persistent slack or outright contraction.</p></div></section>
