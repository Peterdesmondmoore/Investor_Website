<p><em>Probabilistic assessment of the next FOMC policy decision based on the current macro regime, financial conditions, and Fed communications.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The current macro regime is characterized by a "Softening Late-Cycle" in US growth, with a "Cooling with Persistent Underlying Slack" labor market. Inflation exhibits "Normalising Disinflation with Anchored Expectations," despite some tariff-driven stickiness and building producer pressures. Monetary conditions are easing due to liquidity injections and M2 growth, alongside neutral real rates and the cessation of quantitative tightening. Credit conditions are generally benign but show increasing pockets of consumer and small business stress. Global growth is resilient in industrial sectors but with defensive precious metals positioning and deteriorating rates flow momentum. The Federal Reserve has already executed two consecutive rate cuts in Q3/Q4 2025 and concluded balance sheet runoff. However, recent communications emphasize a data-dependent, non-preset course, with strong internal committee disagreement regarding further near-term easing amidst elevated inflation and data uncertainty. This complex backdrop makes a pause the most probable next step: HOLD (70%), CUT (25%), HIKE (5%).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inflation &amp; prices:</strong> Normalising disinflation with anchored expectations, but tariff-driven stickiness persists.</li>
  <li><strong>Labour market:</strong> Cooling with persistent underlying slack, easing tightness at the margin.</li>
  <li><strong>Growth &amp; demand:</strong> Softening late-cycle, uneven demand with strong AI investment contrasting consumer cautiousness.</li>
  <li><strong>Liquidity &amp; financial conditions:</strong> Easing liquidity with neutral real rates and cessation of quantitative tightening.</li>
  <li><strong>Credit &amp; risk:</strong> Generally benign credit, but rising consumer delinquencies and tightening standards for small businesses.</li>
  <li><strong>Global &amp; USD backdrop:</strong> Dollar weakening undercurrent with contradictory positioning risk; resilient industrial metals demand.</li>
  <li><strong>Market pricing &amp; positioning:</strong> Markets pricing in further cuts, but Fed communication pushes back on certainty; high divergence and squeeze risk in specific assets.</li>
  <li><strong>Fed communication tone:</strong> Data-dependent, attentive to dual mandate risks, non-preset course, strongly differing views on future cuts.</li>

<h3>Channel-by-Channel Policy Assessment</h3>

<p>This section decomposes the policy decision into key economic and financial channels, outlining whether each channel is currently exerting pressure toward a CUT, HOLD, or HIKE, or contributing to policy uncertainty.</p>

<h3>Inflation &amp; Price Dynamics</h3>
<p>The inflation regime is one of normalising disinflation, with the broad Fed Inflation Signal in "COOL" territory. However, policy-relevant PCE and Core PCE remain "Neutral" but below their historical median, while market-implied expectations are "STABLE" with decelerating momentum, pushing towards a CUT. This is tempered by "NEUTRAL" CPI-PPI divergence with building producer-side pressures and ongoing tariff impacts, indicating some stickiness and pushing towards HOLD, or even HIKE if tariffs pass-through more aggressively <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: fed_inflation_signal]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Policy_Relevant_Inflation_PCE.html" target="_blank">[Source: policy_relevant_inflation_pce_methodology]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Market_Implied_Inflation.html" target="_blank">[Source: market_implied_inflation_signal.html]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/CPI_PPI_Divergence.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_CPI_vs_PPI_Divergence_Inflation]</a>.</p>

<h3>Labour Market</h3>
<p>The labor market is "Cooling with Persistent Underlying Slack." Employment levels are declining slightly, labor demand is weakening, and firms are managing headcounts through attrition or freezes, as noted in the Beige Book (Nov 2025) <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Wage growth is modest but pressures remain, and underemployment remains elevated despite a "Neutral" regime classification, pushing towards a CUT or at least a HOLD. The Fed has acknowledged increasing downside risks to employment <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: press_monetary_policy]</a>.</p>

<h3>Growth &amp; Business Cycle</h3>
<p>US economic activity is in a "Softening Late-Cycle" regime. National activity is largely unchanged with some districts reporting declines, driven by lower- and middle-income consumer spending pullbacks. Business investment in AI and data centers remains robust, alongside bullish core manufacturing demand, providing resilience. However, overall industrial production is "Neutral" rather than strong, and the yield curve has turned "Bearish" (steepening) for the GS10-FEDFUNDS spread, potentially signaling future slowdown or easing, pushing towards HOLD with a bias for CUT if softening continues <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Durable_Goods_Ex_Transportation.html" target="_blank">[Source: Manufactureres_new_goods.html]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production.html" target="_blank">[Source: industrial_production_signal]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html]</a>.</p>

<h3>Liquidity &amp; Monetary Conditions</h3>
<p>Liquidity conditions are predominantly easing. The Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite is in an "Expansion" regime due to the significant unwinding of the ON RRP facility, and M2 Money Supply is "Bullish" with accelerating impulse, pushing towards a CUT. Real interest rates are in a "Neutral" regime, having stabilized from restrictive levels. The decision to conclude balance sheet runoff effective December 1, 2025, further reinforces the easing of quantitative tightening, providing support for a HOLD or CUT and removing a tightening bias <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Liquidity_Composite.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Liquidity_Composite.html]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/M2_Money_Supply.html" target="_blank">[Source: m_2_money_supply.html]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Real_Interest_Rate_Trend.html" target="_blank">[Source: Real_Interest_Rate_Trend_Signal.html]</a> <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: press_monetary_policy]</a>.</p>

<h3>Credit Conditions &amp; Risk Transmission</h3>
<p>US credit conditions are generally benign. Credit Spreads and the Financial Stress Composite are in "Normal" and "Neutral" regimes, respectively, indicating low systemic stress and historically tight spreads, which generally supports a HOLD. However, the Beige Book (Nov 2025) highlights tightening credit standards, rising consumer loan delinquencies, and struggles for small businesses to obtain credit, signaling pockets of stress and increasing downside risk, pushing towards a CUT to alleviate these pressures <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Credit_Spreads.html" target="_blank">[Source: credit_spreads_methodology.html]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Financial_Stress_Composite.html" target="_blank">[Source: Financial_Stress]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</p>

<h3>Global Backdrop &amp; USD</h3>
<p>The global backdrop presents a "Dollar-Weakening Undercurrent with Contradictory Positioning Risk." The USD Index is "Bullish" (weakening), which typically eases global financial conditions and has an inflationary bias for USD-denominated goods. However, USD futures show stretched speculative short positions against hedger deep longs, creating high tension and potential for a sharp reversal, suggesting a HOLD given the two-sided risks. Global growth is mixed, with some foreign central banks already cutting rates due to disinflation, but core inflation remains elevated in some economies <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/USD_Index_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: usd_index_signal.html]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/USD_CoT_Signals.html" target="_blank">[Source: USD_CoT_Signals]</a> <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: press_monetary_policy]</a>.</p>

<h3>Cross-Asset Positioning &amp; Market Pricing</h3>
<p>Market positioning shows "High Divergence Risk" between speculators and hedgers across many markets, along with "High Squeeze Risk" in the futures complex, implying vulnerability to sharp tactical moves. The VIX is "NORMAL," indicating easing volatility. The "Supply Stress" macro theme is active, driven by hedger deep longs in energy and agriculture. Markets have priced in further cuts beyond the last FOMC meeting, but Chair Powell explicitly pushed back on the idea of a December cut being a "foregone conclusion," creating a tension that supports a HOLD as the most likely outcome for the next decision <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/VIX_Market_Volatility.html" target="_blank">[Source: vix_signal_methodology]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Specs_vs_Hedgers_Divergence_Reversal_Risk.html" target="_blank">[Source: Specs_vs_Hedgers_Divergence_Reversal_Risk.html]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Squeeze_Exhaustion_Risk.html" target="_blank">[Source: Squeeze_Exhaustion_Risk.html]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Regimes_specific_Macro_Themes_Continuous.html" target="_blank">[Source: Regimes_specific_Macro_Themes_Continuous.html]</a> <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: press_monetary_policy]</a>.</p>

<h3>Fed Communications &amp; Reaction Function</h3>
<p>The FOMC has lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at both the September 2025 and October 2025 meetings, shifting policy toward a more neutral stance in light of increased downside risks to employment <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: press_monetary_policy]</a>. Simultaneously, the Committee decided to conclude the reduction of its securities holdings as of December 1, 2025 <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: press_monetary_policy]</a>. Chair Powell explicitly stated that a further reduction in the policy rate at the upcoming December meeting is "not a foregone conclusion" and acknowledged "strongly differing views" among participants, indicating a data-dependent approach with a high bar for immediate further action <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: press_monetary_policy]</a>.</p>

<h3>Qualitative Scenario Path (Next 1–2 Meetings)</h3>

<p>The current regime, marked by a recent easing cycle and cessation of quantitative tightening, is poised for a data-dependent assessment over the next one to two meetings. The Committee's recent actions reflect a shift in the balance of risks towards employment, but inflation remains somewhat elevated and views on the appropriate policy path are divided. The ongoing government shutdown further compounds data uncertainty, likely encouraging a cautious approach for the immediate next decision. Future policy will hinge on the re-availability and interpretation of key macroeconomic indicators.</p>

<h3>Data Gaps &amp; Missing Inputs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Missing or not-yet-released inflation and labor market data from the federal government, due to the shutdown, significantly limit confidence in assessing current economic conditions. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: press_monetary_policy]</a></li>
  <li>Absence of the latest FOMC minutes from the October 28-29, 2025 meeting means specific discussions and nuances beyond the press conference transcript are not fully captured, limiting a complete understanding of the Committee's latest deliberations.</li>
  <li>The full Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from the December 9-10, 2025 FOMC meeting is not yet available, which would provide critical insights into individual participant forecasts for rates, growth, unemployment, and inflation, as well as their assessment of risk balance. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210b.htm" target="_blank">[Source: press_monetary_policy]</a></li>
  <li>The RSS feed lists FOMC statements and economic projections for December 10, 2025, but these documents were not provided as files or text inputs. Access to these would directly inform the most recent policy decision and outlook.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Balance of Risks &amp; Confidence</h3>

<strong>Risks Around the Baseline Decision</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Key conditions that would push the Committee toward an earlier or larger CUT than implied by the baseline: A sharper-than-expected deterioration in labor market conditions, further acceleration in disinflationary trends beyond tariff effects, or a more pronounced weakening in consumer demand.</li>
  <li>Key conditions that would push toward an extended HOLD despite softening data: Persistently elevated inflation readings (even if gradually decelerating), lingering uncertainty about the impact of tariffs, or continued strong divergence of views within the Committee that prioritizes caution over further action.</li>
  <li>Key conditions that could re-open the possibility of a HIKE (even if low probability): A significant re-acceleration of core inflation, particularly in services, unexpected re-tightening of the labor market, or a de-anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Assessment of Confidence</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Medium confidence in the baseline probability split.</li>
  <li>Main sources of uncertainty include the limited availability of recent federal government data due to the shutdown, which impedes a granular understanding of the economy. Additionally, the explicit acknowledgment of "strongly differing views" among Committee members regarding the future path of rates introduces significant policy uncertainty.</li>
</ul>

**Self-healing**
*   **RSS Documents Needed**
    *   Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: press_monetary_policy]</a>: Provides the official announcement for the next policy decision.
    *   Federal Reserve Board and Federal Open Market Committee release economic projections <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210b.htm" target="_blank">[Source: press_monetary_policy]</a>: Contains the latest SEP and dot plot, critical for gauging future policy expectations.
*   **High-Value Inputs to Add**
    *   Real-time federal government economic data: Key inflation (CPI, PPI, PCE) and labor market (jobs report, unemployment rate) releases, especially post-government shutdown, for up-to-date analysis.
    *   FOMC minutes and press conference transcripts for the December 9-10, 2025 meeting: To capture the Committee's latest internal discussions and Chair Powell's interpretation of the decision.
*   **Weaknesses in Provided Inputs**
    *   The latest provided FOMC minutes are from October 28-29, 2025, and the latest Beige Book is November 2025. The task asks for the *next* FOMC decision outlook, implying a need for December 2025 FOMC-related documents which were identified in the RSS feed but not provided as content. *Fix: Provide the actual content for the December 2025 FOMC statement, minutes, and SEP.*
    *   The instruction to "Treat the macro-theme documents as the PRIMARY anchor" when the task is to assess the *next FOMC decision* and recent FOMC communications explicitly address the *upcoming* decision creates a tension. *Fix: Clarify the weighting priority when the most recent FOMC communications directly address the future decision date and contradict market pricing assumptions.*
*   **Prompt Gaps or Issues**
    *   The prompt asked to use "ONLY the information contained in the inputs provided," but then provided RSS feed items for December 10, 2025, which were not actual *content* files. *Fix: Either provide the full content of all RSS-listed documents or clarify that RSS entries only serve as an alert for missing documents.*</div></section>
