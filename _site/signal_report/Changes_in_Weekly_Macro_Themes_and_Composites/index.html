<p><em>Comparing last week’s macro-theme and composite assessments with the latest updates.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The past week saw a notable strengthening in the US liquidity narrative, with M2 money supply re-accelerating and SOFR futures positioning increasingly anticipating less restrictive policy. Globally, growth sentiment exhibited an upward shift driven by improved forward cycle momentum in rates flows, although this was juxtaposed against a clearer "Risk-Off" tone for global trade and an explicit confirmation of a "Weakening USD" in FX dynamics. Cross-asset positioning highlighted an increase in specific downside risks, with "High Squeeze Risk" now active, despite an overall reduction in divergence risk.</p>
<p>Overall, the global macro balance is mixed, leaning towards cautious resilience. While active monetary easing and industrial demand remain supportive, emerging pockets of financial stress, commodity supply constraints, and defensive shifts in speculative sentiment warrant vigilance.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Headline US macro regime: Confirmed active liquidity easing with accelerating money supply and dovish policy expectations.</li>
  <li>Headline Global macro regime: Improved global growth sentiment and explicit weakening USD, but trade sentiment shifted to "Risk-Off" with persistent supply stress.</li>
  <li>Notable changes in inflation vs growth balance: Growth sentiment improved globally, while US inflation remains in a "Cooling / Neutral" state.</li>
  <li>Changes in liquidity/monetary vs credit conditions: US liquidity became more explicitly expansionary; US credit conditions remained broadly stable with underlying stress.</li>
  <li>Changes in labour market vs demand signals: US labor market maintained a "Neutral with Cooling Tendencies" regime.</li>
  <li>Changes in cross-asset positioning &amp; sentiment: Overall speculator-hedger divergence decreased, but specific "High Squeeze Risk" emerged, and VIX moved from "Calm" to "Normal".</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. US Macro Themes: Weekly Change</h3>
<p>The US macro environment demonstrated a more pronounced easing in liquidity and monetary conditions, with M2 money supply showing re-acceleration. Other core US themes, including growth, inflation, credit, and labor markets, remained broadly stable in their prevailing regimes, although some underlying tensions persist.</p>

<h3>2. Global Macro Themes: Weekly Change</h3>
<p>Globally, sentiment around growth improved, marked by a more constructive forward cycle outlook. However, this was tempered by a shift to a "Risk-Off" global positioning tone for trade and a more explicit weakening of the US Dollar, which has implications for global disinflation. Specific commodity positioning also highlighted increased risks.</p>

<h3>3. Composite Macro Overviews: Weekly Change</h3>
<p>The US Macro Overview reflected a more active stance in easing liquidity while acknowledging stable underlying macro conditions. The Global Macro Overview showed a nuanced improvement in growth sentiment alongside a more explicitly identified weakening USD and increased attention to commodity supply stress and risk-off trade sentiment.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Composite</th>
      <th>Previous Regime</th>
      <th>Current Regime</th>
      <th>Direction of Change</th>
      <th>Key Weekly Change</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>US Macro Overview</td>
      <td>Moderating Growth with Disinflationary Bias and Supportive Liquidity</td>
      <td>Complex picture of underlying moderation, with an easing monetary policy stance providing a counter-cyclical impulse. The overall macro regime is characterized by a gradual cooling in the labor market and disinflationary pressures, while credit conditions remain broadly neutral but show signs of underlying stress. Liquidity is actively easing, supported by the Federal Reserve’s actions and re-accelerating money supply.</td>
      <td>Stronger</td>
      <td>Liquidity posture became more explicitly active and expansionary with accelerating M2. Positioning risks from "Supply Stress" and "High Squeeze Risk" were more clearly highlighted in the summary narrative.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Global Macro Overview</td>
      <td>Moderating growth and persistent disinflationary pressures, underpinned by supportive US liquidity conditions. This phase is resilient due to underlying industrial demand, but tempered by decelerating speculative enthusiasm and emerging fragilities.</td>
      <td>Resilient mid-cycle expansion, primarily driven by industrial demand and supported by broadly easing US liquidity. However, this is juxtaposed with underlying physical commodity supply stress and a shift towards selective risk-taking, rather than broad risk-on sentiment.</td>
      <td>Mixed</td>
      <td>Improved global growth sentiment and explicitly easing US liquidity, but with new emphasis on "physical commodity supply stress" and a shift to "risk-off speculative sentiment" for trade.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>4. Cross-Theme Interpretation</h3>
<p>The combination of changes reveals a macro narrative of persistent underlying moderation in US economic activity and inflation, now met with a more assertive and expanding liquidity stance from the Federal Reserve. This active easing is a key counter-cyclical impulse. Globally, there is an improvement in forward-looking growth signals, but this is complicated by an explicit shift to a "Risk-Off" global trade sentiment and a more clearly weakening US Dollar, contributing to a global disinflationary bias. While overall cross-asset divergence risk has reduced, granular positioning analysis indicates rising tactical fragility from "High Squeeze Risk" and persistent commodity "Supply Stress." The divergence between improving global growth sentiment and increasingly defensive trade sentiment and positioning is a notable tension this week.</p>

<h3>5. Forward Risks &amp; Watchpoints</h3>

<h4>Key Upside / Resilience Factors</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Continued and robust easing of US liquidity, particularly sustained M2 acceleration, would provide a significant tailwind to financial conditions.</li>
  <li>Improved forward cycle momentum in global rates flows, if sustained and broadened, signals strengthening global economic expansion.</li>
  <li>Normalization or easing of the "Bearish" Financial Stress Index would indicate improved systemic stability.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Downside / Deterioration Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Escalation of "High Squeeze Risk" in futures markets, potentially triggering sharp, positioning-driven unwinds.</li>
  <li>Persistent or intensifying "Supply Stress" in key commodities could exacerbate price pressures and dampen trade flows.</li>
  <li>A sustained shift to a "Risk-Off" global speculative sentiment for trade could constrain capital flows and risk appetite.</li>
  <li>An explicit weakening of the USD, while disinflationary, could introduce FX volatility and reprice relative asset attractiveness.</li>
