<p><em>
Conditions-based macroeconomic assessment for Federal Reserve policy justification.
</em></p>

<h3>1. Macro Conditions Summary</h3>
<p>
The US macroeconomic landscape is characterized by a continued gradual cooling of the labor market amid persistent, albeit moderating, inflation, creating a complex dual-mandate challenge. Economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace, largely supported by resilient consumer spending among higher-income households and strong business investment in AI infrastructure, which has offset some weakness in housing and other rate-sensitive sectors. The temporary federal government shutdown has introduced near-term economic drag and data uncertainty, but its effects are expected to reverse.
</p>
<p>
Inflation remains elevated relative to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. Both total PCE and core PCE inflation were estimated at 2.8 percent in September and 2.9 percent and 3.0 percent for 2025 respectively in the December SEP, higher than earlier in the year due to increased goods inflation driven by tariffs. While disinflation in housing services continues, other services inflation has been sticky. Input cost pressures, notably from tariffs, insurance, and utilities, are widespread, leading contacts to anticipate upward cost pressures to persist into early 2026, even if pass-through to consumers varies and has been slower than expected. Longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored, but near-term expectations have moved up.
</p>
<p>
The labor market is gradually softening, with employment declining slightly and labor demand weakening across most Districts. Job gains have slowed significantly since earlier in the year, with preliminary estimates suggesting actual job creation may be negative after accounting for systematic overcounts. The unemployment rate has edged up, reaching 4.4 percent in September, and is projected to be 4.5 percent by year-end 2025. Hiring freezes, replacement-only hiring, and attrition are common, while AI is noted as a factor reducing entry-level positions. Worker availability has improved, but specific skilled positions and immigrant worker supply remain difficult. Wage growth is modest overall but outpacing inflation for some sectors.
</p>
<p>
Growth momentum is mixed. Real GDP growth moderated in the first half of 2025 but picked up in the second half, supported by consumer spending and high-tech investment. GDP growth is projected at 1.7 percent for 2025 and 2.3 percent for 2026, slightly stronger than previous projections. Housing activity remains weak due to high mortgage rates and structural shortages. Credit conditions are generally stable, with overall credit remaining available, though tighter for small businesses and low-credit-score households. Delinquency rates for small business loans, CMBS, credit cards, and auto loans have ticked up and remain elevated above pre-pandemic levels.
</p>
<p>
Financial conditions have tightened in money markets, with repo rates increasing relative to administered rates and effective federal funds rate (EFFR) rising relative to the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB). Reserve balances are moving closer to ample levels, prompting the FOMC to initiate purchases of shorter-term Treasury securities in December to maintain ample reserves. The policy stance, following three successive rate cuts totaling 75 basis points since September 2025, is now considered to be within a broad range of estimates of neutral.
</p>
<p>
Risk asymmetry is pronounced: upside risks to inflation remain elevated, while downside risks to employment have increased and are elevated. The Committee acknowledges a "no risk-free path" scenario where its dual mandate goals are in tension. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains high, exacerbated by evolving government policies (tariffs, immigration, fiscal spending) and the federal government shutdown impacting data availability.
</p>

<h3>2. Why a Simple Taylor-Style Rule Is Insufficient</h3>
<p>
A simple, mechanical Taylor-style rule is an inadequate framework for navigating the current macroeconomic environment and formulating monetary policy. The limitations are profound and systematic, reflecting the inherent complexities and behavioral realities of the economy. Firstly, policy reaction coefficients are not static; they are demonstrably time-varying, shifting in response to changes in economic structure, market dynamics, and the perceived costs of missing policy targets. Secondly, the Federal Reserve's dual mandate requires flexible weighting between inflation and labor market objectives, and these weights shift by regime. In a period where both goals are in tension, a rigid rule cannot account for the necessary balancing act. Thirdly, risk asymmetry dominates point estimates. A Taylor rule, focused on deviations from targets, does not inherently account for the disproportionate costs of tail risks—such as unanchored inflation expectations or a sharp rise in unemployment—which often dictate a more cautious or aggressive response than a central tendency alone would suggest. Lastly, high uncertainty and the importance of regime persistence mean that policy decisions cannot be driven by short-term deviations or noisy signals. Instead, a durable policy requires a bias toward continuation unless evidence is decisive and broad-based, mitigating against frequent, destabilizing reversals that a mechanical rule might otherwise induce. The current environment, with its two-sided risks to inflation and employment, tariffs, and AI-driven productivity shifts, underscores the need for a flexible, data-dependent approach that prioritizes risk management over strict adherence to formulaic prescriptions.
</p>

<h3>3. Reaction-Function Relevant Signals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Inflation dynamics: <br>
    <em>Levels vs direction:</em> Total PCE inflation (2.8% in Sep) and core PCE inflation (2.8% in Sep) remain elevated above the 2 percent target, driven largely by goods inflation reflecting tariff pass-through. While services disinflation is continuing, overall price increases are still at a moderate pace, and contacts expect upward cost pressures to persist into 2026 <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: fomcminutes20251029]</a>, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcpresconf20251210.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: powell_pc_20251210]</a>. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_20251101.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: BeigeBook_20251101]</a>. <br>
    <em>Persistence vs moderation:</em> There's a consensus that tariffs contribute to a "one-time price increase" that will gradually fade, but the risk of more persistent inflation, even after tariff effects, remains a key concern <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: fomcminutes20251029]</a>, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcpresconf20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: powell_pc_20251029]</a>. Near-term inflation expectations have risen, but longer-term expectations remain well-anchored to 2 percent <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210b.htm" target="_blank">[Source: monetary20251210b]</a>. <br>
    <em>Upside vs downside inflation risk:</em> Risks to the inflation outlook are assessed as skewed to the upside, primarily due to the potential persistence of tariff-related price pressures and the risk of unanchored longer-term expectations if inflation does not return to target in a timely manner <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: fomcminutes20251029]</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Labour market: <br>
    <em>Composite labour regime:</em> The labor market is in a phase of gradual cooling, characterized by slowing job gains and rising unemployment. While not sharply deteriorating, it exhibits reduced dynamism with low hiring and firing rates <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: fomcminutes20251029]</a>. <br>
    <em>Explicit Slack Gap:</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Direction: SLACKENING (Unemployment rate has edged up to 4.4% in September, and payroll job gains have slowed significantly, potentially turning negative once overcounts are adjusted <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcpresconf20251210.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: powell_pc_20251210]</a>. Labor demand has softened, with businesses implementing hiring freezes and relying on attrition <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_20251101.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: BeigeBook_20251101]</a>).</li>
      <li>Momentum: WIDENING (The unemployment rate is up 0.3 percentage points from June to September, and the pace of job gains is averaging just 40,000 per month since April, indicating increasing slack <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcpresconf20251210.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: powell_pc_20251210]</a>).</li>
      <li>Confidence: MEDIUM (While qualitative reports and state-level data on initial claims and job openings suggest continued gradual cooling <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcpresconf20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: powell_pc_20251029]</a>, the absence of recent official federal employment reports due to the government shutdown introduces uncertainty <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: monetary20251029a]</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Growth & demand: <br>
    <em>Business-cycle phase:</em> The US economy is in a moderate expansion phase, with real GDP growth having moderated in the first half of 2025 but showing signs of firmer trajectory in the third quarter <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: fomcminutes20251029]</a>. Projections for 2025 and 2026 indicate continued moderate expansion <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210b.htm" target="_blank">[Source: monetary20251210b]</a>. <br>
    <em>Momentum vs stall-speed risk:</em> Growth momentum is mixed. Consumer spending remains solid, particularly among higher-income households, and business investment, especially in AI infrastructure, is strong <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcpresconf20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: powell_pc_20251029]</a>. However, the housing sector remains weak, and there are concerns about the narrow base of consumption support. The federal government shutdown poses a temporary downside risk to activity <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: monetary20251210a]</a>. <br>
    <em>Reinforcement or contradiction from credit conditions:</em> Credit conditions generally remain available for most businesses and households but are tightening for small businesses and those with lower credit scores. Rising delinquencies in consumer loans (auto, credit card) and small business loans contradict the otherwise solid aggregate financial health and could dampen future demand <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: fomcminutes20251029]</a>, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_20251101.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: BeigeBook_20251101]</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Financial conditions & liquidity: <br>
    <em>Liquidity impulse:</em> Money market conditions have tightened, with repo rates and the effective federal funds rate rising relative to administered rates. Reserve balances are moving toward ample levels, leading the FOMC to initiate purchases of shorter-term Treasury securities to maintain reserves <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: monetary20251210a]</a>. Balance sheet runoff ceased as of December 1, with reinvestments shifting to Treasury bills <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: monetary20251029a]</a>. <br>
    <em>Real-rate regime:</em> Nominal Treasury yields are little changed, with real yields rising somewhat at short maturities as inflation compensation decreased <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: fomcminutes20251029]</a>. The overall real rate environment, while having softened, remains elevated relative to historical averages. <br>
    <em>Policy stance relative to Neutral Rate (r*):</em> The target range for the federal funds rate has been lowered to 3.5-3.75 percent following three successive cuts, bringing the policy stance into a "broad range of estimates of its neutral value" <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcpresconf20251210.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: powell_pc_20251210]</a>. This suggests the policy stance is now <em>NEAR NEUTRAL</em>, having moved from a restrictive posture. There is no clear consensus on the directional drift of r* among participants.
  </li>
  <li>Risk asymmetry & regime persistence: <br>
    <em>Upside inflation vs downside growth risks:</em> There is a clear tension between elevated upside risks to inflation and increased downside risks to employment <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: monetary20251210a]</a>. The labor market softening and rising unemployment raise concerns about a sharper-than-expected slowdown, while tariff-driven goods inflation poses a risk of persistent price pressures <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: fomcminutes20251029]</a>. <br>
    <em>Signal alignment vs contradiction:</em> Signals are contradictory, with strong GDP growth contrasting with weak job creation and varied consumer spending patterns ("K-shaped economy") <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcpresconf20251029.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: powell_pc_20251029]</a>. This requires a balanced approach to policy decisions <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: monetary20251210a]</a>. <br>
    <em>Bias toward continuation unless decisively broken:</em> The Committee emphasizes that policy is not on a preset course and will be data-dependent, requiring careful assessment of incoming information and the evolving balance of risks <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: monetary20251210a]</a>. The recent shift to a "wait and see" approach after three cuts indicates a bias towards maintaining the current stance until decisive, broad-based evidence warrants further adjustment <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcpresconf20251210.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: powell_pc_20251210]</a>.

  <li>
    <strong>US Labour Market (including an explicit Slack Gap assessment)</strong> —
    This thematic document, expected to provide explicit regime classifications, momentum assessments, and methodology/thresholds for the labor market and Slack Gap, was not provided. The Slack Gap assessment was synthesized from qualitative descriptions and specific metrics within the FOMC Minutes, SEP, Beige Book, and Press Conferences.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>US Growth & Business Cycle</strong> —
    This thematic document, which would typically define business cycle phases, momentum assessments, and stall-speed risks with explicit methodology, was not provided. Growth and demand assessments were derived from GDP and PDFP data and qualitative reports in other Fed documents.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>US Credit Conditions</strong> —
    This thematic document, expected to provide regime classifications and momentum for credit conditions, was not provided. Credit conditions and their reinforcement/contradiction were inferred from discussions in FOMC Minutes and the Beige Book.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>US Liquidity & Monetary Conditions (including explicit Neutral Rate / r* context where available)</strong> —
    This thematic document, expected to provide explicit classifications of liquidity impulse, real-rate regime, and a clear assessment of the neutral rate (r*) with its directional drift, was not provided. These aspects were synthesized from FOMC Minutes and Press Conferences, but a dedicated, structured input on these themes would enhance precision.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cross-Asset Positioning & Sentiment</strong> —
    This thematic document, which would explicitly detail cross-asset positioning and sentiment indicators for risk asymmetry, was not provided. Risk asymmetry was assessed based on the FOMC's internal evaluation of upside inflation vs. downside employment risks, rather than market positioning data.

<ul>
  <li><strong>High-Value Inputs to Add:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Structured macro theme documents (Inflation, Labor Market, Growth, Credit, Liquidity, Positioning): Would provide explicit regime classifications, momentum, methodologies, and thresholds for direct integration, reducing inferential steps and enhancing precision.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Weaknesses in Provided Inputs:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of explicit Slack Gap regime/momentum/confidence directly from theme document: Requires deriving these from disparate qualitative and quantitative signals. Fix: Provide a dedicated "US Labour Market" theme document with the requested Slack Gap structure.</li>
      <li>Absence of clear, consistent committee-wide assessment of 'r*' directional drift: Makes precise policy stance relative to neutral rate ambiguous beyond a broad range. Fix: Include explicit r* estimates and expected directional drift as part of the "US Liquidity & Monetary Conditions" theme or SEP.</li>
      <li>Government shutdown affecting official data: While noted by Powell <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm" target="_blank">[Source: monetary20251029a]</a>, actual impact on *missing data points* for input themes is not explicitly listed. Fix: Provide a list of expected government data points and their current availability status.</li>
