<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The current US business cycle displays a mixed character, leaning towards a late-cycle deceleration with underlying fragilities. National economic activity has largely remained unchanged, with a notable shift towards softening as two Districts reported modest declines in the November 2025 Beige Book, contrasting with a more balanced prior period. Consumer spending has declined further, particularly among lower- and middle-income segments, while manufacturing activity shows modest increases overall <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</p>
<p>Quantitative signals largely reflect this nuanced environment. While core manufacturing demand remains robust, broader business investment momentum is stable. The yield curve indicates a shift to a bearish posture driven by steepening, while housing activity is neutral following a period of expansion. Labor markets are easing slightly, but pricing pressures persist moderately <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Capex direction: Neutral, having recently emerged from a contractionary phase <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Capex_Intent.html" target="_blank">[Source: Durable_goods_capex_intent_methodology.html]</a>.</li>
  <li>Durables conditions: Bullish, driven by robust short-term momentum in core manufacturing orders <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Durable_Goods_Ex_Transportation.html" target="_blank">[Source: Manufactureres_new_goods.html]</a>.</li>
  <li>Industrial production trend: Neutral, with modest YoY growth insufficient to trigger a bullish signal, amidst rising mining share <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production.html" target="_blank">[Source: industrial_production_signal]</a>.</li>
  <li>Yield-curve state: Bearish for the GS10-FEDFUNDS spread due to steepening momentum <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html]</a>, but Flat/Neutral for the broader composite slope <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Yield_Curve_Slope.html" target="_blank">[Source: yield_curve_slope_methodology.html]</a>.</li>
  <li>Beige Book signals: Labour demand softening, modest wage growth, moderate price increases, tightening credit standards, rising consumer loan delinquencies, and overall decline in consumer spending <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
  <li>Overall growth risk bias: Negative, with softening conditions and financial stress signals offsetting some manufacturing resilience.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Business Investment &amp; Capex Intent</h3>
<p>The Capex Intent signal is currently in a Neutral regime as of September 2025, with durable goods orders growing 7.26% year-over-year <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Capex_Intent.html" target="_blank">[Source: Durable_goods_capex_intent_methodology.html]</a>. This follows a brief Contraction regime in August 2025, which saw a sharp decline in short-term momentum, and an Expansion regime in May 2025. The current Neutral classification indicates stable order momentum consistent with a baseline investment pace, neither rapidly expanding nor significantly weakening <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Capex_Intent.html" target="_blank">[Source: Durable_goods_capex_intent_methodology.html]</a>.</p>
<p>According to the November 2025 Beige Book, manufacturing activity overall saw a modest increase, but tariffs and trade policy uncertainty continue to act as significant headwinds <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. This qualitative assessment aligns with the quantitative Capex Intent signal, suggesting that while there is some activity, corporate investment is not in a robust expansionary phase, with businesses exhibiting caution.</p>

<h3>2. Core Manufacturing Demand: Durable Goods ex-Transportation</h3>
<p>The Durable Goods ex-Transportation signal indicates a Bullish regime as of September 2025 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Durable_Goods_Ex_Transportation.html" target="_blank">[Source: Manufactureres_new_goods.html]</a>. This is supported by a 3-month percentage change of 1.93% and year-over-year growth of 3.09%. The signal has maintained a Bullish stance since June 2025, primarily driven by consistent near-term momentum exceeding the +1% threshold <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Durable_Goods_Ex_Transportation.html" target="_blank">[Source: Manufactureres_new_goods.html]</a>.</p>
<p>This firming manufacturing demand, as captured by the ex-transportation series, aligns with the Beige Book's observation of a modest increase in overall manufacturing activity <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. While the YoY growth rate is not currently exceeding the +5% bullish threshold, the strong 3-month momentum suggests an ongoing, albeit moderate, expansion in core manufacturing orders, providing a counterpoint to some of the broader economic softening.</p>

<h3>3. Real-Economy Activity: Industrial Production</h3>
<p>The Industrial Production signal is currently in a Neutral regime as of September 2025 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production.html" target="_blank">[Source: industrial_production_signal]</a>. Year-over-year industrial production growth stands at 1.62%, which is not sufficiently robust (below the +3% threshold) to trigger a Bullish signal. Simultaneously, the mining share of GDP year-over-year has risen significantly by 40.32%, indicating supply pressures that prevent a Bullish classification <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production.html" target="_blank">[Source: industrial_production_signal]</a>.</p>
<p>This Neutral classification contrasts with a consistent Bearish signal observed throughout 2024, which was driven by weak industrial demand (YoY below 0%) alongside increasing mining share <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production.html" target="_blank">[Source: industrial_production_signal]</a>. The Beige Book's report of a modest increase in manufacturing activity nationally, despite tariffs and trade policy uncertainty, generally supports the Neutral signal, indicating some recovery in industrial demand but not a strong, unconstrained expansion <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Yield-Curve Signals</h3>
<p>The US Treasury yield curve signal, based on the GS10-FEDFUNDS spread, turned Bearish in November 2025 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html]</a>. The 10-year Treasury yield was 4.09% against an effective federal funds rate of 3.88%, resulting in a positive spread of 0.21%. This Bearish signal is specifically driven by the yield spread exceeding its 3-month moving average trend of 0.027%, indicating a steepening of the curve <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html]</a>. This shift follows a prolonged Bullish phase, often characterized by inverted spreads, that extended from January 2023 to October 2024 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html]</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast, the broader Yield Curve Slope composite, which uses 10Y-2Y and 10Y-3M spreads, remained in a Flat/Neutral regime throughout 2025, concluding at a composite value of 0.530957 in December 2025 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Yield_Curve_Slope.html" target="_blank">[Source: yield_curve_slope_methodology.html]</a>. This signifies a balanced environment of growth and inflation pressures, not indicative of extreme inversion or steepening risk, and aligns with the Beige Book's assessment of largely unchanged economic activity, with some softening <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. The shift to a Bearish GS10-FEDFUNDS signal, driven by steepening, potentially validates the Beige Book's judgment about an underlying economic softening or expectations for future policy adjustments.</p>

<h3>5. Beige Book Conditions</h3>
<p>The November 2025 Federal Reserve Beige Book indicates that overall U.S. economic activity remained largely unchanged, though with a notable shift towards softening as two Districts reported modest declines <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Business sentiment reflects caution due to ongoing trade policy uncertainty and consumer price sensitivity <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Regional demand patterns are mixed, with consumer spending further declining nationally, particularly among lower- and middle-income households who are showing increased signs of financial distress and relying more on debt. Manufacturing saw a modest increase, but nonfinancial services were generally flat to down <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</p>
<p>The labor market experienced a slight decline in employment levels, with roughly half of the Districts observing weaker labor demand, leading to increased layoff announcements and firms managing headcounts through hiring freezes and attrition <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Wage growth maintained a modest pace, but some sectors faced moderate wage pressures. Pricing pressures remained moderate overall, though input costs were widespread (tariffs, insurance, utilities, healthcare), and firms reported increased margin compression as their ability to pass through these costs varied. Credit conditions were mixed, with loan demand declining overall in some Districts but increasing modestly for residential mortgages due to lower rates, while credit standards generally tightened. A concerning trend of rising consumer loan delinquencies was noted, alongside struggles for small businesses to obtain credit <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesised US Growth &amp; Cycle Assessment</h3>
<p>The interplay of quantitative signals and qualitative Beige Book insights suggests the US economy is operating in a period best characterized as a **Softening Late-Cycle**. While core manufacturing demand (Durable Goods ex-Transportation) shows bullish momentum, the broader Capex Intent signal is neutral, reflecting underlying stability rather than robust expansion in business investment. Industrial production, while no longer bearish, remains neutral, failing to demonstrate strong demand-driven growth <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production.html" target="_blank">[Source: industrial_production_signal]</a>.</p>
<p>The yield curve provides mixed but cautionary signals. The GS10-FEDFUNDS spread has turned bearish due to steepening, potentially anticipating slower growth or future policy easing <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html" target="_blank">[Source: US_Treasury_Yield_Curve.html]</a>, though the composite slope remains flat/neutral, indicating no immediate extreme shifts <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Yield_Curve_Slope.html" target="_blank">[Source: yield_curve_slope_methodology.html]</a>. The Beige Book reinforces the narrative of softening conditions, with declining consumer spending, easing labor demand, and tightening credit conditions, specifically highlighting rising consumer delinquencies and small business credit struggles <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Housing, a traditional leading indicator, is also neutral after earlier expansion, consistent with high mortgage rates and affordability issues <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Housing_Lead.html" target="_blank">[Source: housing_lead_methodology]</a>. Combined, these suggest a growth environment characterized by decelerating momentum and increasing financial friction.</p>

<h3>6. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Capex or durables acceleration: Sustained improvement in core durable goods orders could pull the broader Capex Intent signal into expansion, suggesting renewed business confidence and investment.</li>
  <li>Industrial production re-acceleration: Industrial production moving into a bullish regime (INDPRO YoY > +3%) without significant mining share increase would signal robust demand.</li>
  <li>Curve normalisation signalling improved expectations: A re-steepening of the yield curve from inversion or flat conditions, driven by rising long-term growth expectations rather than short-term policy easing.</li>
  <li>Beige Book improvement in demand or labour supply: Broad-based improvement in consumer spending, easing of credit conditions, and a more balanced labor market with reduced wage pressures.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Capex retrenchment: A return of the Capex Intent signal to a contractionary regime, indicating businesses are pulling back on investment commitments.</li>
  <li>Manufacturing stall speed: Durable Goods ex-Transportation signal moving to neutral or bearish, reflecting a significant slowdown in core manufacturing orders.</li>
  <li>Policy tightening or renewed curve inversion: Further Fed tightening beyond market expectations or a renewed, deep inversion of the yield curve, signaling increased recession risk.</li>
  <li>Beige Book deterioration in credit or demand: Accelerated decline in consumer spending, broadening of loan delinquencies, and a significant tightening of credit availability, further dampening economic activity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>This Softening Late-Cycle growth regime implies a heightened sensitivity of broad risk appetite to incoming data, particularly concerning consumer resilience and credit conditions. Equity markets may face headwinds from moderating growth and persistent cost pressures, leading to potential margin compression for corporations. Cyclical sectors might experience mixed performance, with core manufacturing showing some strength but overall industrial activity and business investment remaining constrained <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Durable_Goods_Ex_Transportation.html" target="_blank">[Source: Manufactureres_new_goods.html]</a> <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production.html" target="_blank">[Source: industrial_production_signal]</a>.</p>
<p>Credit markets could exhibit increased differentiation, with rising consumer loan delinquencies and tightening credit standards suggesting fragility in certain segments <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. The yield curve's steepening could imply bond market anticipation of future policy easing or growth deceleration, influencing duration positioning. This environment calls for a focus on asset classes with defensive characteristics or those that perform well in disinflationary or slowing growth scenarios, balanced against the resilience observed in specific manufacturing segments. The overall market exhibits a momentum-driven recovery in some areas, juxtaposed with increasing financial fragility and demand-side weakness.</p>

  <li>**High-Value Inputs to Add:** Provide explicit data for the Housing Lead signal for Q4 2025 (Permits, Housing Starts) to ensure the most recent assessment of residential activity.</li>
  <li>**Weaknesses in Provided Inputs:** The 'Capex_Sources' column in the Capex Intent data consistently shows "DGORDER only," indicating that the preferred ADXTNO (Durable Goods Ex-Transportation) series was not utilized, potentially limiting the composite's accuracy as per its methodology <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Capex_Intent.html" target="_blank">[Source: Durable_goods_capex_intent_methodology.html]</a>. Ensure the ADXTNO series is provided to allow its incorporation into the Capex Intent signal.</li>
  <li>**Prompt Gaps or Issues:** The prompt requests analysis of "housing-related indicators (if present)," which was addressed using the Housing Lead signal. Clarify if a more detailed breakdown of individual housing components (e.g., home sales, inventory) from the Beige Book or other data sources is desired in future responses.</li>
