  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><p><em>Synthesising capex, production, durables, housing, Beige Book conditions and yield-curve signals.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The US economy exhibits characteristics of a late-cycle deceleration, marked by divergent trends across key sectors. Real activity, as indicated by industrial production, is in a neutral regime with modest growth, while core manufacturing demand shows positive momentum. However, overall economic conditions, per the Beige Book, reflect a slight net softening, driven by weakening consumer spending and tighter credit.</p>
<p>Leading indicators present a mixed picture: business investment intent is volatile, housing remains neutral with underlying permit weakness, and yield curve signals are conflicting, with an inverted policy-sensitive spread contrasting with a broader flat/neutral slope.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Capex Intent: Neutral, after recent volatility and a sharp deceleration.</li>
  <li>Durables ex-Transportation: Bullish, indicating firming core manufacturing demand.</li>
  <li>Industrial Production: Neutral, showing modest growth with increasing mining output.</li>
  <li>Yield Curve vs Fed Funds: Bullish (inverted/flat), suggesting a restrictive policy stance.</li>
  <li>Yield Curve Slope (Composite): Flat/Neutral, indicating compressed but not deeply inverted spreads.</li>
  <li>Beige Book Signals: Easing labor market, moderate but persistent input cost pressures, deteriorating consumer credit quality, and softening demand across several regions.</li>
  <li>Overall Growth Risk Bias: Downside risks from consumer retrenchment, policy uncertainty, and tightening credit conditions, partially offset by some resilience in manufacturing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Business Investment &amp; Capex Intent</h3>
<p>The Capex Intent composite registered a Neutral regime at 0.137 as of September 2025. This follows a volatile period that included a brief Contraction regime in August 2025 (-1.547) and a strong Expansion in May 2025 (4.979). The August contraction was notably driven by a sharp deceleration in the DGORDER 3-month annualised growth, reflected in an extreme z-score of -3.57.</p>
<p>Beige Book commentary indicates overall caution regarding business capital expenditure, with some manufacturers expressing optimism but many contacts citing increased risks of slower activity and delayed longer-term investment plans due to economic and policy uncertainty. Sector-specific investments in areas such as AI infrastructure were noted as providing some boosts.</p>
<p>Corporate investment appears to be stabilizing in a neutral regime after significant fluctuations, with underlying forward sentiment remaining cautious despite pockets of strength.</p>

<h3>2. Core Manufacturing Demand: Durable Goods ex-Transportation</h3>
<p>The Durable Goods ex-Transportation signal is currently Bullish as of September 2025. This classification is primarily driven by a 3-month percentage change of 1.92%, which exceeds the +1% bullish threshold. Year-over-year growth also registered a positive 3.07%.</p>
<p>The YoY z-score stands at 0.18, suggesting that the current positive momentum is not in an extreme or stretched positioning. Regional Beige Book reports indicate that manufacturing activity improved somewhat across most Districts, representing a positive shift from prior conditions. However, tariffs and related uncertainties continue to act as headwinds, affecting input costs and demand for exports, even as AI data center investments contribute to activity in some areas.</p>

<h3>3. Real-Economy Activity: Industrial Production</h3>
<p>Industrial Production is in a Neutral regime as of August 2025, with year-over-year growth at 0.84%. This signal has consistently been Neutral since early 2025, following a prolonged Bearish period throughout most of 2024, characterized by negative industrial production growth and a rising mining share.</p>
<p>The current Neutral classification is influenced by a substantial 39.66% year-over-year increase in the mining share of GDP (RIWG21222S_YoY), which, despite positive industrial output, prevents a Bullish signal. The Beige Book noted a national improvement in manufacturing activity, though no specific demand-driven versus supply-driven shifts for overall industrial production or capacity constraints were detailed.</p>

<h3>4. Yield-Curve Signals</h3>
<p>The Treasury curve versus Fed Funds spread (GS10-FEDFUNDS) is in a Bullish regime, registering -0.03% in October 2025. This indicates a flat or inverted curve, which has persisted for three consecutive months and typically signals a restrictive policy stance and potential forward-growth stress. A brief Bearish signal appeared in June 2025 (0.05%) due to steepening momentum that subsequently unwound.</p>
<p>The composite Yield Curve Slope (10Y-2Y and 10Y-3M) is in a Flat/Neutral regime, with a composite value of 0.367 in November 2025. Both the 10Y-2Y spread (0.55%) and 10Y-3M spread (0.14%) are positive but compressed. The GS10-FEDFUNDS signal, suggesting a restrictive policy, broadly aligns with the Beige Book's sentiment of increased risks of slower activity and deteriorating credit conditions. However, the Flat/Neutral composite slope, while compressed, does not reflect a deep inversion, offering a more stable view of the term structure compared to the policy-sensitive spread.</p>

<h3>5. Beige Book Conditions</h3>
<p>Business sentiment is largely unchanged overall, with many contacts expressing concerns about slower activity ahead despite some optimism from manufacturers. Regional demand patterns are characterized by largely unchanged national economic activity, with consumer spending showing further declines, particularly among lower- and middle-income segments. Manufacturing activity improved somewhat, contrasting with nonfinancial services that were generally flat to down. Residential real estate saw a net decline, while commercial real estate was mixed.</p>
<p>The labor market exhibits easing conditions, with employment levels declining slightly and weaker demand noted by approximately half of the Districts. Firms are relying on hiring freezes, attrition, and adjusting work hours, alongside some evidence of AI replacing entry-level positions. Labor availability generally improved, although skilled shortages persist. Pricing pressures remain moderate, driven by robust and widespread input cost increases (tariffs, insurance, utilities, healthcare). Firms face varied abilities to pass these costs, leading to reports of margin compression. Credit conditions have softened, with loan demand mixed to slightly lower, and a notable rise in consumer loan delinquencies and defaults, indicating deteriorating credit quality and tightened lending standards.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesised US Growth &amp; Cycle Assessment</h3>
<p>The US growth and business cycle assessment reveals a complex and potentially decelerating late-cycle environment. Business investment intent, while volatile, has recently stabilized at a neutral pace, supported by bullish momentum in core manufacturing orders. However, this is set against a backdrop of overall industrial production remaining neutral, partly due to increased mining output.</p>
<p>The Beige Book paints a picture of a subtly softening economy, with weakening consumer demand, an easing labor market, and a notable deterioration in consumer credit quality and tightening lending standards. Yield curve signals are mixed; while the GS10-FEDFUNDS spread indicates a restrictive policy stance consistent with late-cycle stress, the broader yield curve slope composite suggests a more neutral, albeit compressed, term structure. Taken together, the dominant cycle regime is best characterized as <strong>Late-Cycle Deceleration with Emerging Fragilities</strong>, where underlying demand and financial conditions show signs of stress, even as some industrial sectors maintain positive momentum.</p>

<h3>6. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Durable goods acceleration sustains into broader business investment.</li>
  <li>Industrial production re-accelerates, driven by stronger underlying demand.</li>
  <li>Yield curve normalizes more steeply from a neutral stance, signalling improved forward expectations.</li>
  <li>Beige Book reports sustained improvement in regional demand or greater labor supply.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Capex retrenchment following recent volatility.</li>
  <li>Manufacturing momentum stalls or reverses due to tariff impacts or weakening global demand.</li>
  <li>Sustained yield curve inversion or renewed steepening from current low levels, signaling further policy tightening or recessionary expectations.</li>
  <li>Beige Book reports further deterioration in consumer demand, credit quality, or business sentiment, exacerbated by policy uncertainty.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The prevailing growth regime, characterized by late-cycle deceleration and emerging fragilities, suggests a cautious environment for broad risk appetite. While segments of manufacturing show resilience, the softening consumer demand, easing labor conditions, and deteriorating credit quality indicate increasing sensitivity to economic headwinds.</p>
<p>Sectors reliant on consumer spending and access to credit may face headwinds. The mixed yield curve signals – restrictive policy vs. stable slope – suggest a nuanced financial conditions backdrop, where rate-sensitive assets may exhibit fragility while longer-duration assets could find support if growth concerns deepen. The divergence between resilient high-end consumer spending and struggling lower-to-middle-income segments points to a bifurcated economic experience.</p></div></section>
