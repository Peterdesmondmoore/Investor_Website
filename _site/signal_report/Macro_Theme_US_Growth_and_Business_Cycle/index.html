  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Current U.S. growth momentum presents a mixed picture, with signs of stabilization and strengthening in specific sectors alongside persistent financial market caution. Core durable goods manufacturing exhibits firming demand, suggesting targeted strength in the real economy. However, broader industrial production and business investment intent remain in a neutral regime, indicating a moderate rather than accelerating pace.</p>
<p>The business cycle classification reflects a nuanced state, potentially transitioning from a slowdown phase towards stabilization or re-acceleration in certain industrial segments. This contrasts with the financial market signals from the yield curve, where one measure indicates a persistent inversion, historically signaling late-cycle conditions or future contractionary pressures. This divergence necessitates careful monitoring.</p>
<p>The breadth and consistency of signals are divergent. Core durable goods (ex-transport) are bullish, while capex intent, industrial production, and housing activity are neutral. The yield curve measures provide conflicting signals, with one indicating inversion (implying caution) and the other a flat/neutral posture (implying balance).</p>

<h2>Aggregate Business Cycle State</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Capex momentum and investment intent:</strong> The capex intent signal is in a neutral regime, indicating stabilization in business investment following a contractionary period in August 2025.</li>
  <li><strong>Industrial production and manufacturing output:</strong> Industrial production is in a neutral regime, with modest year-over-year growth (0.84%) and a significant increase in the mining sector's share of GDP (39.66% YoY), reflecting supply-side expansion.</li>
  <li><strong>Core durable goods demand (ex-transport):</strong> Core durable goods demand is in a bullish regime, driven by strong 3-month (1.92%) and positive year-over-year (3.07%) momentum, indicating firming manufacturing demand.</li>
  <li><strong>Housing activity and lead indicators:</strong> Housing activity is in a neutral regime. Mortgage rates have softened, but permits and starts momentum show a slight downward bias, suggesting cautious stability.</li>
  <li><strong>Yield curve and recession-risk signal:</strong> One yield curve measure (GS10-FEDFUNDS) indicates a "Bullish" signal due to persistent inversion, suggesting elevated recession risk. The other yield curve measure (T10Y2Y, T10Y3M) is "Flat/Neutral", implying a late-cycle balance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall growth backdrop is characterized by divergent signals, with core manufacturing strength amidst a broader neutral industrial and housing environment, while the yield curve presents conflicting but generally cautious forward-looking financial signals.</p>

<h2>Capex & Investment Intent</h2>
<p>The capex intent signal implies a neutral direction for business investment, having transitioned through periods of expansion earlier in 2025, followed by a contractionary phase in August 2025, and now returning to a stable position in September 2025.</p>
<p>The signal exhibited a turning point from an "Expansion" phase in May 2025 to a "Contraction" in August 2025, subsequently recovering to "Neutral" in September 2025. This sequence indicates a deceleration of the prior decline and a movement towards stabilization, rather than a re-entry into a strong expansionary regime.</p>
<p>The signal for September 2025 (0.14) indicates stabilization from a recent deterioration. The current regime is "Neutral," following a "Contraction" (-1.55) in the prior month, reflecting a moderating rate of change and a movement from contraction back to stability.</p>

<h2>Industrial Production & Manufacturing</h2>
<p>Industrial production (INDPRO) is at a level (101.27 as of August 2025) indicative of modest momentum, with a year-over-year growth rate of 0.84%. This is below the +3% threshold for a bullish classification, contributing to the current "Neutral" signal.</p>
<p>The current neutral regime for industrial production follows an extended bearish phase observed through most of 2023 and 2024. This suggests a stabilization in overall industrial activity but not a clear cyclical acceleration. The significant year-over-year increase in the mining sector's share of GDP (39.66%) indicates an expansion in primary supply pressure.</p>
<p>Industrial production's "Neutral" status aligns with the "Neutral" capex intent signal, suggesting a consistent, moderate pace for overall industrial activity and business investment. No sustained divergences between industrial production and the capex signal are indicated at this time.</p>

<h2>Core Durable Goods (Ex-Transportation)</h2>
<p>The underlying demand for core manufactured goods is firming, as indicated by a "Bullish" signal for Durable Goods ex-Transportation.</p>
<p>Recent changes include a year-over-year growth rate of 3.07% and a robust short-horizon (3-month) growth rate of 1.92%. Both metrics exceed their respective bullish thresholds.</p>
<p>The signal consistently points to firming demand, characterized by sustained positive momentum in order growth. The "Bullish" regime has been maintained since June 2025, suggesting a persistent upward trend in core durable goods demand rather than short-term noise.</p>

<h2>Housing & Construction Lead Indicators</h2>
<p>Housing activity, as inferred by the Housing Lead signal, is currently in a "Neutral" regime. While the latest permits and housing starts data are from August 2025, mortgage rate information extends to November 2025.</p>
<p>Housing activity appears to be moderating the broader growth signal, indicating cautious stability rather than strong amplification of expansionary forces.</p>
<p>The housing regime shifted from a brief "Expanding" phase in February 2025 to "Neutral," where it has remained. There has not been a material regime shift over recent quarters from neutral, though the mortgage rate component has softened from 6.95% in January 2025 to 6.23% in November 2025.</p>
<p>Based on the supplied data, housing points to continued stability within a neutral range. Easing mortgage rates may offer some support, but permit and start momentum from August 2025 suggests no immediate strong strengthening in demand.</p>

<h2>Yield Curve & Macro Cycle Signal</h2>
<p>The current yield curve regime presents conflicting signals based on two distinct methodologies. The composite T10Y2Y/T10Y3M yield curve slope signal is in a "Flat/Neutral" regime (0.367 as of November 2025), while the GS10-FEDFUNDS spread indicates a "Bullish" signal (-0.03% as of October 2025), reflecting a sustained inverted curve.</p>
<p>The "Flat/Neutral" regime implies a late-cycle balance, suggesting an equilibrium between growth and inflation pressures without strong expectations for aggressive monetary policy shifts. Conversely, the "Bullish" (inverted) GS10-FEDFUNDS signal, which has persisted from August through October 2025, historically precedes economic slowdowns, indicating restrictive policy and forward-growth stress.</p>
<p>There is a divergence between the yield curve signals and real-economy growth indicators. Real-economy indicators (Capex, Industrial Production, Housing) generally suggest a "Neutral" or "Bullish" (core durables) state, implying stability or mild growth. However, the GS10-FEDFUNDS yield curve signal, signaling an inversion, contradicts this, pointing to elevated recession risk or tighter financial conditions that could impact future real economy activity.</p>
<p>The yield curve signals are conflicting across their methodologies. The T10Y2Y/T10Y3M composite is not confirming a contraction, but the GS10-FEDFUNDS spread is contradicting the observed business-cycle phase by signaling a defensive "Bullish" regime, indicative of future economic stress.</p>

<h2>Cross-Indicator Synthesis</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistent signals:</strong> Capex Intent, Industrial Production, and Housing Lead are consistently in a "Neutral" regime, indicating a moderate and stable pace of activity across these real-economy indicators.</li>
  <li><strong>Key divergences or conflicts:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Core Durable Goods (ex-transport) is "Bullish," indicating firming demand, which contrasts with the "Neutral" status of broader industrial production and capex intent.</li>
      <li>The GS10-FEDFUNDS yield curve signal is "Bullish" (inverted), implying recession risk and conflicting with the prevailing "Neutral" or "Bullish" (core durables) real-economy indicators. The T10Y2Y/T10Y3M yield curve, however, is "Flat/Neutral," offering a less alarming financial signal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Breadth of the cycle:</strong> The cycle appears mixed, with concentrated strength in core manufacturing (Durable Goods ex-transport) but a broader "Neutral" stance across other real-economy indicators. The financial signals from the yield curve are divergent but lean towards caution.</li>
  <li><strong>Short-horizon vs. medium-horizon growth indications:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Short-horizon (3-month) growth in core durable goods is strong (1.92%), contributing to its "Bullish" signal. Capex Intent's 3-month annualized growth (2.45%) supported its return to "Neutral" from "Contraction."</li>
      <li>Housing indicators show a slight downward bias in momentum, despite easing mortgage rates, suggesting short-term caution.</li>
      <li>Medium-horizon (year-over-year) indicators for Industrial Production are weak (0.84%), while core durable goods are moderately positive (3.07%). The long-standing yield curve inversion (GS10-FEDFUNDS) points to medium-term economic stress.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Watchpoints (Forward-Looking Conditions)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A sustained increase in the Capex Intent signal above 0.75, moving it into an "Expansion" regime, would confirm a broad-based improvement in business investment.</li>
  <li>A shift in Industrial Production year-over-year growth above +3% would signal a re-acceleration of industrial demand, moving it from a "Neutral" to a "Bullish" regime.</li>
  <li>A transition of the Housing Lead signal into a sustained "Expanding" regime, supported by positive permits and starts momentum and further easing of mortgage rates, would signal future strengthening in consumer demand and construction activity.</li>
  <li>A steepening of the GS10-FEDFUNDS yield spread to consistently positive territory (e.g., above 0.5%) would resolve the conflict with real-economy indicators by reducing immediate recessionary concerns.</li>
  <li>A weakening of the 3-month percentage change in Core Durable Goods below -1% would signal a deterioration in core manufacturing demand.</li>
  <li>A decline in the mining share of GDP (RIWG21222S_YoY) below 0% alongside weak industrial production would signal a bearish demand-supply imbalance for industrial commodities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Current U.S. growth exhibits mixed strength and resilience. While core manufacturing shows firming demand and a "Bullish" regime, broader industrial activity and business investment intent are stable within a "Neutral" regime. Housing activity similarly maintains a cautious-stable "Neutral" state.</p>
<p>The data suggests a balance where some cyclical components, particularly core durables, are showing signs of improvement. However, structural dynamics, potentially reflected in the persistent yield curve inversion (GS10-FEDFUNDS), suggest underlying financial caution and potential future headwinds. The other yield curve measure indicates a flat/neutral state, further contributing to the mixed financial market outlook.</p>
<p>The current environment appears stable within a neutral growth band for most real-economy indicators. However, the inverted GS10-FEDFUNDS yield curve signal introduces a fragility or risk of future inflection towards an economic slowdown that is not yet fully reflected in real activity data. The stability is therefore conditional on the eventual resolution of this divergence between real activity and financial market signals.</p>

<h2>Model and Prompt Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Missing data or signals that would improve growth-cycle assessment:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicit forward guidance or surveys on business capital expenditure plans.</li>
      <li>Broader sentiment indicators, such as the ISM Services PMI and consumer confidence indices.</li>
      <li>Comprehensive employment data, including jobless claims and payroll growth.</li>
      <li>Inventory-to-sales ratios for manufacturing and retail sectors.</li>
      <li>Real wage growth to better gauge consumer purchasing power and its impact on demand.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Suggested refinements to the signal set or prompt structure:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorporate the relative performance of cyclical versus defensive sectors in equity markets for real-time validation of growth regimes.</li>
      <li>Include credit impulse or broader financial conditions indices to better capture the transmission of monetary policy.</li>
      <li>Provide a specific "Business Cycle Classification" output (e.g., Expansion, Slowdown, Contraction, Recovery) based on the comprehensive synthesis of all indicators.</li>
      <li>Request a confidence score for the overall growth assessment to reflect the degree of signal consistency or divergence.</li>
    </ul>
