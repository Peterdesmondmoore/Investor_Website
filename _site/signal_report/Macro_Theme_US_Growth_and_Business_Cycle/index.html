<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The current market assessment indicates a business cycle in a transitional state, characterized by mixed signals across key real activity and financial indicators. While core manufacturing exhibits resilience and positive momentum, broader business investment intent shows significant volatility. Real economy activity, as measured by industrial production, is stable but not robustly expanding, and the housing sector is navigating a neutral phase amid fluctuating mortgage rates. Yield curve diagnostics present a cautious outlook, with an inverted policy-to-long-term spread contrasted by a flat/neutral broader term structure.</p>
<p>This confluence of signals suggests an environment of late-cycle dynamics with underlying uncertainties, necessitating a nuanced approach to macroeconomic interpretation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Capex direction or uncertainty: Business Investment &amp; Capex Intent is currently in a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime as of September 2025, reflecting indecisive corporate investment appetite following recent volatility.</li>
  <li>Manufacturing / durables conditions: Core manufacturing demand, specifically Durable Goods ex-Transportation, is assessed as <strong>Bullish</strong> as of September 2025, indicating firming orders and sustained positive momentum.</li>
  <li>Industrial production trend: Real-economy Industrial Production is in a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime as of August 2025, driven by modest year-over-year growth tempered by a significant increase in the mining share of GDP.</li>
  <li>Housing market dynamics: The Housing Lead signal is <strong>Neutral</strong> as of August 2025, with permits and starts showing moderated activity amid elevated mortgage rates.</li>
  <li>Yield-curve positioning: The Treasury curve vs Fed Funds spread is <strong>Bullish</strong> (inverted) as of October 2025, while the Yield Curve Slope composite is <strong>Flat/Neutral</strong> as of November 2025, presenting a mixed but generally cautious signal from the rates market.</li>
  <li>Overall growth risk bias: The aggregate signal suggests a late-cycle environment with pockets of demand resilience but persistent underlying growth risks from investment volatility, subdued broader industrial activity, and cautionary financial conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Business Investment &amp; Capex Intent</h3>
<p>The Capex Intent signal, derived from durable goods orders, registered a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime as of September 30, 2025. This follows a period of notable volatility, including an "Expansion" phase in May 2025 (4.98) and a subsequent "Contraction" in August 2025 (-1.55). The latest neutral reading (0.14) is underpinned by 7.24% year-over-year growth and 2.45% three-month annualized growth in total durable goods orders. This rapid oscillation suggests an environment of underlying uncertainty in corporate investment appetite rather than a sustained directional trend.</p>

<h3>2. Core Manufacturing Demand: Durable Goods ex-Transportation</h3>
<p>Core manufacturing demand, as indicated by Durable Goods ex-Transportation, is classified as <strong>Bullish</strong> as of September 30, 2025. This signal shows a year-over-year growth of 3.07% and a three-month growth of 1.92%. The indicator has maintained a "Bullish" stance for four consecutive months (June-September 2025), following a "Neutral" period from January to May 2025. This sustained positive momentum reflects firming demand within the manufacturing sector, excluding the often-volatile transportation component.</p>

<h3>3. Real-Economy Activity: Industrial Production</h3>
<p>Industrial Production is in a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime as of August 1, 2025. This follows a shift from a "Bearish" phase that characterized much of 2024. Current industrial production (INDPRO) shows modest year-over-year growth of 0.84%. However, this is accompanied by a significant 39.66% year-over-year expansion in the mining share of GDP (RIWG21222S). The combination of positive but subdued industrial demand and strong supply-side growth from mining prevents a "Bullish" classification, indicating stable but not robust real economy activity.</p>

<h3>4. Housing Market Lead Indicators</h3>
<p>The Housing Lead signal indicates a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime as of August 31, 2025, with a composite value of -0.207. This follows a brief "Expanding" period earlier in February 2025. Mortgage rates averaged 6.23% in November 2025. Building permits stood at 1330k and housing starts at 1307k in August 2025, both having moderated from their earlier 2025 peaks. This suggests a consolidation phase in the housing market, where permits and starts activity is subdued and mortgage rates remain a relevant influencing factor.</p>

<h3>5. Yield-Curve Signals</h3>
<p>The Treasury curve relative to the Fed Funds rate indicates a <strong>Bullish</strong> regime as of October 1, 2025. The 10-year Treasury yield spread to the Effective Federal Funds Rate is -0.03%, with a three-month trend also negative at -0.0667%. This inverted curve traditionally signifies a restrictive monetary policy stance and has historically preceded economic slowdowns, suggesting a cautious outlook for growth.</p>
<p>Conversely, the composite Yield Curve Slope (10Y-2Y and 10Y-3M spreads) is classified as <strong>Flat/Neutral</strong> as of November 30, 2025, with a composite value of 0.367497. This regime has persisted consistently over the past year, implying a balance between growth and inflation pressures without clear indications of aggressive policy easing or tightening, thus presenting a mixed signal from the term structure.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesised US Growth &amp; Cycle Assessment</h3>
<p>The synthesis of current market intelligence indicates a complex and transitional US growth and business cycle. Core manufacturing demand demonstrates resilience, contrasting with a volatile and currently neutral corporate investment appetite. Broader industrial activity is stable but not accelerating, and the housing sector is consolidating. The yield curve provides mixed signals: an inverted short-to-long spread suggests latent contraction risk, while a broader composite slope indicates a flat/neutral environment. This configuration points to a <strong>Late-Cycle Transition</strong> where pockets of strength coexist with persistent headwinds and forward-looking caution.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>
<h4>Upside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sustained positive momentum in core manufacturing (Durables ex-Transportation) could broaden to overall business investment if corporate confidence solidifies.</li>
  <li>A further easing of mortgage rates could provide a tailwind to housing activity, contributing to broader consumer spending and construction.</li>
  <li>A reacceleration of industrial production growth above 3% year-over-year could signal stronger underlying real activity.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Downside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Persistent volatility in Capex Intent could lead to retrenchment in business investment, dampening future productive capacity.</li>
  <li>The inverted yield curve (GS10-FEDFUNDS) remains a historical precursor to economic contraction, indicating potential future policy missteps or growth deceleration.</li>
  <li>A prolonged period of neutral industrial production growth, particularly alongside rising mining share, points to an uneven and potentially stalling economic recovery.</li>
  <li>Continued elevated mortgage rates or further increases could suppress housing market activity and its associated economic multipliers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>This macro regime, characterized by a mix of resilient demand pockets, volatile investment intent, and cautionary yield curve signals, typically supports a balanced portfolio approach. Selectivity within cyclical sectors, favoring companies with robust balance sheets and pricing power, may be warranted. Simultaneously, a sustained allocation to defensive assets is indicated by the inverted yield curve, reflecting potential future economic challenges. Credit conditions may experience differentiated tightening, with weaker borrowers facing higher scrutiny. Rates sensitivity is expected to remain elevated due to uncertainty regarding the duration of current monetary policy and its ultimate impact on economic expansion.</p></div></section>
