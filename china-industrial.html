            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>
                The China Manufacturing PMI for August 2025 registered 49.4, indicating a continued contraction in manufacturing activity for the fourth consecutive month, signaling a moderately bearish overall market sentiment. While production remained slightly in expansion at 50.8, key sub-indices such as new orders (46.6) and employment (45.6) showed persistent contraction, highlighting weakening demand and a subdued labor market.

                For Industrial Metals, the outlook is leaning bearish. Despite ongoing production expansion, the significant decline in new orders and reduction in raw material inventories (48.0) suggest an anticipated future slowdown in demand. This trend points to potential headwinds for the sector.

                Regarding China equities, the sentiment is also moderately bearish. The sustained contraction across the manufacturing sector, particularly in new orders and employment, suggests a challenging operating environment. This is likely to exert pressure on corporate earnings and revenues, especially within industrial and manufacturing-heavy sectors, indicating risks of further economic deceleration.
