        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument maintains a <strong>strong underlying bullish trend</strong> across all significant timeframes, supported by robust momentum and directional strength. However, the latest hourly snapshot indicates a minor short-term pullback and a failure to sustain above immediate resistance, resulting in a temporary neutral signal for the current hour.

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dominant Bullish Trend:</strong> The current Close (<span class="data-point">116.970001</span>) stands firmly above all short-term (SMA_20H: <span class="data-point">113.83050</span>, EMA_20H: <span class="data-point">114.741432</span>), medium-term (SMA_50H: <span class="data-point">113.4792</span>, EMA_50H: <span class="data-point">113.082713</span>), and long-term (EMA_200H: <span class="data-point">110.293343</span>) moving averages, confirming a robust uptrend [Trend Indicators].</li>
            <li><strong>Sustained Momentum:</strong> MACD (<span class="data-point">1.398372</span>) remains above its signal line (<span class="data-point">0.974017</span>) with a positive MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">0.424355</span>), indicating ongoing bullish momentum [Momentum Indicators].</li>
            <li><strong>Strong Directional Strength:</strong> The ADX_14H at <span class="data-point">32.124906</span> signifies a strong trending market, with DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">51.165997</span>) significantly exceeding DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">18.381398</span>), reinforcing the bullish directional bias [Directional Movement].</li>
            <li><strong>Hourly Retracement:</strong> The latest hour shows a negative return of <span class="data-point">-0.007972</span>, with the price retracting after previous gains and closing below the daily VWAP (<span class="data-point">117.344914</span>) [Hourly Return, Volume-based Indicators].</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance Encountered:</strong> The current Close (<span class="data-point">116.970001</span>) is below the 24H Resistance level (<span class="data-point">117.910004</span>), suggesting a failure to sustain higher levels after testing previous resistance [Support/Resistance].</li>
            <li><strong>RSI Not Overbought:</strong> The RSI_14H at <span class="data-point">63.598737</span> indicates strong buying interest without yet reaching extreme overbought conditions (typically >70) [Momentum Indicators].</li>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trend-Following Opportunity:</strong> Given the dominant bullish trend, traders should prioritize long positions. Consider entry points during short-term pullbacks, potentially near the EMA_20H (approx. <span class="data-point">114.74</span>), if bullish confirmation reappears.</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance Monitoring:</strong> A decisive breakout and sustained close above the 24H Resistance (<span class="data-point">117.910004</span>) would signal renewed bullish acceleration and potential for further upward movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Short-Term Caution:</strong> The hourly retracement and neutral signal suggest immediate upside may be limited. Avoid aggressive new long entries at current levels until price action confirms renewed upward momentum.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: 0 (Neutral)</strong></p>
            <p>
                This summary signal indicates a neutral short-term market bias for the instrument at the current hour. While the underlying trend remains strongly bullish, the immediate price action does not meet the criteria for an explicit 'Buy' or 'Sell' recommendation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            For the latest hourly snapshot, all specific boolean flags such as <code>Break_Up_24H</code>, <code>Vol_Spike</code>, <code>Bull_Engulfing_H</code>, <code>Hammer_H</code>, <code>Gap_Up_H</code>, <code>Gap_Down_H</code>, <code>Break_Down_24H</code>, <code>Vol_Breakout_Up</code>, and <code>Vol_Breakout_Down</code> are <strong>False</strong>. This means that in this *specific* hour, there were no new explicit breakout events, significant volume spikes, or specific bullish/bearish candlestick patterns. The instrument is currently consolidating after a strong prior move.
