        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument exhibits a <strong>strong underlying bullish trend</strong> across all timeframes, reinforced by robust directional strength. However, recent hourly price action shows waning short-term momentum and consolidation below the daily VWAP, indicating a potential near-term pause or minor pullback within the broader uptrend.

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strong Bullish Trend Confirmed:</strong> The current Close price (<span class="data-point">41.970001</span>) is significantly above all short-term (SMA_20H: <span class="data-point">41.398430</span>, EMA_20H: <span class="data-point">41.402191</span>), medium-term (SMA_50H: <span class="data-point">39.499498</span>, EMA_50H: <span class="data-point">39.885651</span>), and long-term (EMA_200H: <span class="data-point">36.611208</span>) moving averages.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust Directional Strength:</strong> The ADX_14H at <span class="data-point">45.452376</span> signals a very strong trending market, with DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">40.180490</span>) significantly higher than DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">19.318513</span>), confirming bullish control.</li>
            <li><strong>Momentum Deceleration:</strong> MACD (<span class="data-point">0.997281</span>) has crossed below its MACD_Signal line (<span class="data-point">1.088037</span>), and MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">-0.090756</span>) is negative, indicating a short-term loss of bullish momentum and a potential pullback.</li>
            <li><strong>Intraday Selling Pressure:</strong> Close (<span class="data-point">41.970001</span>) below daily VWAP (<span class="data-point">42.680263</span>) signals a lack of strong intraday buying interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy RSI:</strong> The RSI_14H at <span class="data-point">63.803900</span> is strong but not yet in the extreme overbought region, allowing for potential further upside if momentum resumes.</li>
            <li><strong>Consolidating Price Action:</strong> Price trades above BB_Mid_20H (<span class="data-point">41.398430</span>) but below 24H Resistance (<span class="data-point">43.017899</span>), indicating consolidation.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintain Long Bias:</strong> The dominant trend is bullish. Favor long positions, viewing short-term pullbacks as potential buying opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor Momentum Shift:</strong> The MACD's bearish cross and negative MACD_Hist warrant caution. Wait for MACD to turn positive or cross above its signal line for renewed bullish momentum confirmation.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Levels:</strong> EMA_20H (approx. <span class="data-point">41.402191</span>) and SMA_20H (approx. <span class="data-point">41.398430</span>) provide immediate support. A decisive break above 24H Resistance (<span class="data-point">43.017899</span>) signals strong continuation.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Despite the strong trend, current momentum deceleration makes aggressive new entries premature. Consider smaller position sizing or tighter stop-losses during consolidation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: <span class="data-point">0</span> (Neutral)</strong></p>
            <p>
                The summary signal of <span class="data-point">0</span> denotes a neutral stance. While strong bullish underlying trends persist, conflicting short-term momentum signals (e.g., negative MACD_Hist, price below VWAP) prevent a clear 'Buy' or 'Sell' recommendation.
            </p>
        </div>
