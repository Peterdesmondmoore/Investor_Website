    </p>

    <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument is exhibiting a <strong>strong underlying bullish trend</strong> across multiple timeframes, confirmed by moving averages and directional strength. However, the latest hourly snapshot shows signs of short-term consolidation or a minor pullback, indicated by a negative hourly return and a bearish MACD crossover, leading to a neutral immediate signal.

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Robust Uptrend Confirmed:</strong> The Close price (<span class="data-point">32.948299</span>) is positioned above all short-term (SMA_20H: <span class="data-point">32.489480</span>, EMA_20H: <span class="data-point">32.434100</span>), medium-term (SMA_50H: <span class="data-point">30.382060</span>, EMA_50H: <span class="data-point">30.934299</span>), and long-term (EMA_200H: NaN, *Note: EMA_200H data is not available for the latest snapshot*) moving averages.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong Directional Movement:</strong> The ADX_14H at <span class="data-point">33.807885</span> indicates a strong trend, with DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">49.982243</span>) significantly dominant over DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">22.755499</span>), reinforcing the bullish direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of Short-Term Momentum:</strong> The MACD (<span class="data-point">0.833746</span>) has crossed below its Signal line (<span class="data-point">0.914744</span>), with a negative MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">-0.080998</span>), signaling a recent loss of bullish momentum or a potential short-term reversal.</li>
            <li><strong>Recent Pullback:</strong> The instrument registered a negative Hourly Return of <span class="data-point">-1.94%</span> in the latest hour, trading below the 24H Resistance level (<span class="data-point">33.892399</span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral RSI:</strong> The RSI_14H at <span class="data-point">60.028049</span> is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating room for potential movement in either direction after the current consolidation.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Bullish Stance:</strong> Given the confirmed uptrend from moving averages and ADX/DI+, traders with a longer horizon may maintain a bullish bias.</li>
            <li><strong>Short-Term Caution:</strong> The negative MACD histogram and hourly return suggest short-term weakness. Traders looking to initiate new long positions might await confirmation of renewed bullish momentum, such as a MACD bullish crossover.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Levels to Watch:</strong> Monitor for potential bounces from dynamic support levels, such as the EMA_20H (approx. <span class="data-point">32.43</span>), which could offer more favorable entry points for long positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance Monitoring:</strong> A decisive break above the 24H Resistance (<span class="data-point">33.89</span>) on increased volume would signal a continuation of the rally.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: <span class="data-point">0</span> (Neutral)</strong></p>
            <p>
                The summary signal of <span class="data-point">0</span> indicates a neutral stance for the instrument at this specific hour. This reflects the mixed technical picture, where a strong underlying bullish trend is contending with recent short-term negative momentum as indicated by the MACD and the hourly return.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            For the latest hourly snapshot, all specific boolean flags such as <code>Vol_Spike</code>, <code>Break_Up_24H</code>, <code>Break_Down_24H</code>, <code>Vol_Breakout_Up</code>, <code>Vol_Breakout_Down</code>, and all candlestick patterns (<code>Bull_Engulfing_H</code>, <code>Hammer_H</code>, <code>Gap_Up_H</code>, <code>Gap_Down_H</code>) are <strong>False</strong>. This confirms that there were no significant breakout events, volume anomalies, or specific candlestick patterns forming in this immediate hour that would provide a distinct directional signal, aligning with the overall neutral assessment.
