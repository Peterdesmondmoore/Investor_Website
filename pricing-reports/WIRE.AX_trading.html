        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strong Bullish Trend Confirmed:</strong> The Close price (<span class="data-point">16.42</span>) is firmly above all short (SMA_20H: <span class="data-point">16.3355</span>, EMA_20H: <span class="data-point">16.307975</span>), medium (SMA_50H: <span class="data-point">16.1700</span>, EMA_50H: <span class="data-point">16.165509</span>), and long-term (EMA_200H: <span class="data-point">15.449539</span>) moving averages, confirming a strong, sustained uptrend.</li>
            <li><strong>Dominant Uptrend Strength:</strong> ADX_14H (<span class="data-point">30.06</span>) indicates a strong trend, with DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">30.05</span>) significantly above DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">18.19</span>), validating the robust bullish direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Positive Momentum and Intraday Buying:</strong> RSI_14H (<span class="data-point">60.86</span>) is in bullish territory, and the Close price (<span class="data-point">16.42</span>) above VWAP_Day (<span class="data-point">16.331057</span>) highlights consistent intraday buying pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Consolidation Near Resistance:</strong> Price (<span class="data-point">16.42</span>) is consolidating just below 24H Resistance (<span class="data-point">16.49</span>). MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">-0.007127</span>) shows a minor short-term momentum deceleration near this level.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Recent Activity:</strong> The latest hour recorded extremely low volume (<span class="data-point">8</span>) and flat price action (<span class="data-point">0.00%</span> hourly return), indicating minimal recent trading activity.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintain Bullish Bias:</strong> Traders should retain a bullish outlook, given the prevailing trend and directional strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance Breakout Key:</strong> Monitor for a decisive breakout above the 24H Resistance level (<span class="data-point">16.49</span>). A confirmed break, ideally on increased volume, would signal a continuation of the rally.</li>
            <li><strong>Potential Entry Points:</strong> For new long positions, consider entries on a confirmed breakout or a pullback to retest support levels, such as the EMA_20H (approximately <span class="data-point">16.31</span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Short-Term Pullback Risk:</strong> The slight MACD divergence suggests potential for minor consolidation or a shallow pullback before the next significant move.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: 1 (Buy)</strong></p>
            <p>
                The summary signal <span class="data-point">1</span> explicitly confirms a strong bullish bias for WIRE.AX. This reflects the predominant bullish alignment across trend and directional indicators.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            For the latest hourly snapshot, all specific boolean flags (e.g., <code>Vol_Spike</code>, <code>Break_Up_24H</code>, candlestick patterns) are <strong>False</strong>. This is primarily due to the extremely low volume (<span class="data-point">8</span>) and flat price action, which prevented the generation of new pattern-based or breakout signals during this specific period. The "Buy" signal therefore stems from the overarching, established bullish market structure.
