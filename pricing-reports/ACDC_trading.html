        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument is currently exhibiting a **dominant bearish trend** across all timeframes. Trend strength is weak, suggesting a lack of strong directional conviction, and the price remains significantly below key moving averages. While initial signs of short-term bullish momentum are emerging, the latest hour saw a negative return accompanied by a significant volume spike, reinforcing overall selling pressure. The market currently holds a neutral stance.

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strong Bearish Trend Confirmed:</strong> The current `Close` price (<span class="data-point">3.62</span>) is well below all short-term (SMA_20H: <span class="data-point">3.65</span>, EMA_20H: <span class="data-point">3.65</span>), medium-term (SMA_50H: <span class="data-point">3.73</span>, EMA_50H: <span class="data-point">3.72</span>), and long-term (EMA_200H: <span class="data-point">4.29</span>) moving averages. This firmly establishes a dominant downtrend.</li>
            <li><strong>Weak Trend Strength:</strong> The `ADX_14H` at <span class="data-point">10.92</span> indicates a weak overall market trend, suggesting a period of consolidation or a lack of strong directional conviction.</li>
            <li><strong>Bearish Directional Bias:</strong> Despite the weak ADX, `DI-_14H` (<span class="data-point">19.40</span>) is higher than `DI+_14H` (<span class="data-point">14.68</span>), reinforcing the underlying bearish pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Emerging Bullish Momentum (from bearish base):</strong> While `MACD` (<span class="data-point">-0.0398</span>) remains in negative territory, it has crossed above its `MACD_Signal` (<span class="data-point">-0.0440</span>) with a positive `MACD_Hist` (<span class="data-point">0.0042</span>). This indicates a short-term increase in buying momentum, potentially signaling a slowing of the prior bearish impulse.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Selling Activity:</strong> The latest hourly candle experienced a significant `Vol_Spike` (<span class="data-point">True</span>) with `Volume` (<span class="data-point">544523</span>) well above `Avg_Vol_24H` (<span class="data-point">282720.17</span>), coinciding with a negative `Hourly Return` (<span class="data-point">-0.69%</span>). This indicates heightened selling pressure during the price decline.</li>
            <li><strong>Price Below Mid-Bollinger Band:</strong> The `Close` (<span class="data-point">3.62</span>) is below the `BB_Mid_20H` (<span class="data-point">3.65</span>), reinforcing short-term bearish sentiment and indicating the price is trading in the lower half of its recent volatility range.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintain Bearish Stance:</strong> Given the dominant downtrend and price trading below key moving averages, a bearish outlook remains appropriate. Traders might look for opportunities to initiate or add to short positions on any rallies towards immediate resistance levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor for Reversal Confirmation:</strong> While `MACD_Hist` shows a potential shift, confirmation of a significant bullish reversal would require `MACD` crossing above zero and the price breaking decisively above short-term moving averages (around <span class="data-point">3.65</span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Key Support Level:</strong> The `Sup_24H` at <span class="data-point">3.54</span> is a critical level. A sustained break below this support, especially on high volume, would likely accelerate the downtrend.</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance Zones:</strong> The short-term moving averages (SMA_20H, EMA_20H) around <span class="data-point">3.65</span> act as immediate resistance. The `Res_24H` at <span class="data-point">3.80</span> represents a stronger barrier for any meaningful recovery.</li>
            <li><strong>Volatility Impact:</strong> The recent `Vol_Spike` suggests increased interest and potential for larger price swings. Traders should be prepared for heightened volatility and observe how the price reacts around critical support and resistance levels.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="signal-breakdown">
        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: <span class="data-point">0</span> (Neutral)</strong></p>
            <p>
                The summary `Signal` value of <span class="data-point">0</span> indicates a **Neutral** market stance. This suggests that, based on the aggregate of all technical indicators, there isn't a strong, immediate trigger for a definitive buy or sell action. This aligns with the weak trend strength and the conflicting signals from momentum indicators (bearish price action but emerging bullish MACD divergence).
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            For the latest hourly snapshot, the only boolean flag marked as `True` is `Vol_Spike`. This means the current hourly volume (<span class="data-point">544523</span>) is significantly higher than the 24-hour average volume (<span class="data-point">282720.17</span>). This increased activity, coinciding with a negative `Hourly Return` (<span class="data-point">-0.69%</span>), indicates heightened selling pressure during this period. All other breakout and candlestick pattern flags, such as `Break_Up_24H`, `Bull_Engulfing_H`, `Hammer_H`, `Gap_Up_H`, `Gap_Down_H`, `Vol_Breakout_Up`, and `Vol_Breakout_Down`, are `False`, indicating no immediate confirmed pattern or breakout event in this specific hour.
