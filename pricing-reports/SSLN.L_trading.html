        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument is currently within a <strong>strong established uptrend</strong>, as evidenced by price remaining well above all major moving averages. However, recent hourly data shows a <strong>short-term bearish momentum divergence</strong> through the MACD, coupled with intraday selling pressure (price below VWAP). This combination suggests immediate <strong>neutrality and potential for consolidation</strong> within the broader bullish context.

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strong Established Uptrend:</strong> The current Close (<span class="data-point">3117.00</span>) is positioned robustly above all short-term (SMA_20H: <span class="data-point">3109.57</span>, EMA_20H: <span class="data-point">3100.14</span>), medium-term (SMA_50H: <span class="data-point">3018.89</span>, EMA_50H: <span class="data-point">3046.55</span>), and long-term (EMA_200H: <span class="data-point">2917.61</span>) moving averages, confirming a dominant bullish trend.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong Trend Strength:</strong> ADX_14H at <span class="data-point">36.64</span> indicates a strong trend is active, with DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">25.70</span>) still maintaining a lead over DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">18.40</span>), albeit with weakening positive directional pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Positive Relative Strength:</strong> RSI_14H (<span class="data-point">64.31</span>) is above 50, reflecting underlying bullish strength, though it has cooled from previously overbought levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Hourly Price Recovery:</strong> The instrument posted a positive Hourly Return of <span class="data-point">0.32%</span> in the latest period, indicating a rebound from earlier lows.</li>
            <li><strong>Bearish Momentum Divergence:</strong> MACD (<span class="data-point">26.912</span>) is significantly below its MACD_Signal (<span class="data-point">32.879</span>) with a deepening negative MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">-5.967</span>), signaling a clear short-term bearish momentum shift within the broader uptrend.</li>
            <li><strong>Intraday Selling Pressure:</strong> The current Close (<span class="data-point">3117.00</span>) is below the daily VWAP (<span class="data-point">3120.92</span>), suggesting current intraday prices are below the average volume-weighted traded price, implying selling pressure during the session.</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance Approach:</strong> The price is currently below the 24H Resistance level (<span class="data-point">3131.00</span>), suggesting it faces an immediate hurdle for further upside.</li>
            <li><strong>Narrowing Volatility:</strong> Bollinger Band Width (<span class="data-point">0.0247</span>) has decreased, indicating a reduction in volatility and potential for consolidation.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Bullish Strategy:</strong> Given the robust underlying uptrend, traders should maintain a bullish bias. Consider initiating or adding to long positions on significant pullbacks towards key dynamic support levels like the EMA_20H (<span class="data-point">3100.14</span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Short-Term Caution:</strong> The bearish MACD divergence and intraday selling pressure (Close below VWAP) warrant caution for aggressive new long entries. Wait for momentum indicators to confirm a renewed bullish impetus.</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance Breakout Key:</strong> A decisive break above the 24H Resistance at <span class="data-point">3131.00</span> on increased volume would validate a continuation of the rally. Conversely, rejection could lead to further consolidation.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor for Volatility Expansion:</strong> The narrowing Bollinger Bands often precede a breakout. Be prepared for a potential increase in volatility and a directional move once consolidation ends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: Neutral (0)</strong></p>
            <p>
                This summary signal indicates a neutral stance. It suggests that the aggregated technical indicators are currently presenting a balanced or inconclusive picture, despite the underlying long-term trend. The instrument may be in a consolidation phase or experiencing conflicting short-term signals.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            For the latest hourly snapshot, all specific boolean flags such as <code>Break_Up_24H</code>, <code>Vol_Spike</code>, etc., are <strong>False</strong>. This suggests a period of consolidation or lack of immediate, sharp directional catalysts in the very short term, despite the underlying trend dynamics.
