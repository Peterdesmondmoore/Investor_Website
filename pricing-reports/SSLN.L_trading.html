        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strong Bullish Trend Confirmed:</strong> The current Close price (<span class="data-point">3094.735</span>) is significantly above all short-term (SMA_20H: <span class="data-point">3025.873</span>, EMA_20H: <span class="data-point">3037.424</span>), medium-term (SMA_50H: <span class="data-point">2977.646</span>, EMA_50H: <span class="data-point">2990.920</span>), and long-term (EMA_200H: <span class="data-point">2887.120</span>) moving averages.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust Momentum:</strong> MACD (<span class="data-point">38.015</span>) is well above its signal line (<span class="data-point">32.747</span>) with a positive MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">5.268</span>), indicating strong and sustained bullish momentum.</li>
            <li><strong>Dominant Uptrend Strength:</strong> The ADX_14H at <span class="data-point">36.691</span> signals a strong trending market, and DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">41.798</span>) is considerably higher than DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">16.105</span>), confirming the uptrend.</li>
            <li><strong>Intraday Buying Pressure:</strong> The current Close (<span class="data-point">3094.735</span>) is well above the daily VWAP (<span class="data-point">3081.592</span>), indicating strong buying interest throughout the trading day.</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance Breakout:</strong> The `Break_Up_24H` flag is <span class="data-point">True</span>, with the Close price (<span class="data-point">3094.735</span>) decisively above the 24H Resistance level (<span class="data-point">3091.0</span>). This is a significant bullish development.</li>
            <li><strong>Overbought Conditions:</strong> The RSI_14H at <span class="data-point">76.948</span> is deep in the overbought region, which often precedes a short-term pullback or consolidation.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Long Positions:</strong> Maintain existing long positions. New long entries can consider waiting for a retest of the broken 24H Resistance (now immediate support at approx. <span class="data-point">3091.0</span>) or a stronger pullback towards the EMA_20H (approx. <span class="data-point">3037.424</span>) for better risk-reward.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirmation of Breakout:</strong> Monitor for the broken 24H Resistance (<span class="data-point">3091.0</span>) to act as strong support. A successful retest and hold of this level would reinforce the bullish outlook.</li>
            <li><strong>Overbought Caution:</strong> While momentum is strong, the high RSI warns against aggressive new entries without proper risk management or confirmation of continued upward movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Implement trailing stops to protect gains given the significant upward move and overbought RSI, as a short-term correction is possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: <span class="data-point">1</span> (Buy)</strong></p>
            <p>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            For the latest hourly snapshot, the `Break_Up_24H` flag is <strong><span class="data-point">True</span></strong>. This signifies a significant bullish event where the price has successfully broken above a key 24-hour resistance level, often indicative of further price appreciation. All other specific boolean flags, such as `Vol_Spike`, `Vol_Breakout_Up`, `Bull_Engulfing_H`, `Hammer_H`, `Gap_Up_H`, `Gap_Down_H`, and `Break_Down_24H`, are <strong><span class="data-point">False</span></strong>. This means that while a decisive price breakout over resistance occurred, it did not coincide with an extreme volume spike or any specific hourly candlestick patterns in this latest hour.
