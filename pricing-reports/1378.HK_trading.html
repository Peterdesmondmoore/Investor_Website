        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument is currently under significant short-term selling pressure, marked by a substantial hourly decline and high volume. While the long-term trend remains upward, the price has fallen below key short and medium-term moving averages. A potential bullish divergence in MACD suggests a possible weakening of bearish momentum, but overall sentiment is bearish for the immediate future.

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bearish Price Action:</strong> The current Close (<span class="data-point">25.50</span>) is trading below the SMA_20H (<span class="data-point">25.659</span>), SMA_50H (<span class="data-point">25.7136</span>), EMA_20H (<span class="data-point">25.647033</span>), and EMA_50H (<span class="data-point">25.669034</span>), indicating clear short-to-medium term weakness.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong Selling Pressure:</strong> The instrument experienced a significant hourly return of <span class="data-point">-0.8554%</span> on a `Vol_Spike` [CITE: Vol_Spike] with <span class="data-point">7,305,500</span> volume [CITE: Volume], suggesting strong conviction in the recent price drop.</li>
            <li><strong>Dominant Bearish Direction:</strong> DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">29.136373</span>) is notably higher than DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">19.867048</span>) [CITE: DI+_14H, DI-_14H], confirming bears control the directional movement. The ADX_14H at <span class="data-point">19.594809</span> [CITE: ADX_14H] indicates a weak trending market.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Trend Intact:</strong> Despite short-term weakness, the Close (<span class="data-point">25.50</span>) remains above the long-term EMA_200H (<span class="data-point">24.672242</span>) [CITE: Close, EMA_200H], preserving the overall bullish bias.</li>
            <li><strong>Emerging Bullish Momentum Divergence:</strong> MACD (<span class="data-point">-0.064386</span>) has crossed above its MACD_Signal (<span class="data-point">-0.081098</span>) with a positive MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">0.016712</span>) [CITE: MACD, MACD_Signal, MACD_Hist], suggesting a potential short-term shift in momentum despite the hourly price decline.</li>
            <li><strong>Below Daily VWAP:</strong> The current price is trading below the VWAP_Day (<span class="data-point">25.572221</span>) [CITE: Close, VWAP_Day], reinforcing the intraday bearish sentiment.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Short-Term Avoidance/Short Opportunity:</strong> Traders should avoid initiating new long positions due to significant selling pressure and bearish short-term indicators. Consider short opportunities if the instrument fails to reclaim key moving averages (e.g., EMA_20H at <span class="data-point">25.647033</span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor for Reversal Confirmation:</strong> While MACD suggests potential for momentum shift, observe for price stabilization and confirmation (e.g., bullish candlestick pattern or positive hourly close) before considering long entries. Look for support around the 24H Support (<span class="data-point">25.059999</span>) or the EMA_200H (<span class="data-point">24.672242</span>).</li>
            <li><strong>Volume Significance:</strong> The `Vol_Spike` during the hourly decline (<span class="data-point">-0.8554%</span> return) suggests a strong move. Any bullish reversal would require similarly strong buying volume to negate this.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> For existing long positions, consider tightening stop-losses. For short positions, monitor the MACD divergence as a potential early warning of a trend reversal.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="signal-breakdown">
        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: -1 (Sell)</strong></p>
            <p>
                This summary signal indicates a strong bearish bias for the instrument. It suggests that the aggregated technical indicators predominantly favor a short position or avoiding long entries in the near term.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            The `Vol_Spike` is <strong>True</strong> [CITE: Vol_Spike], confirming unusually high trading volume (<span class="data-point">7,305,500</span>) [CITE: Volume] compared to the 24-hour average (<span class="data-point">4,420,624</span>) [CITE: Avg_Vol_24H]. This spike accompanied a significant hourly price drop, reinforcing the strong selling pressure. All other specific boolean flags such as `Break_Up_24H`, `Break_Down_24H`, `Vol_Breakout_Up`, `Vol_Breakout_Down`, `Bull_Engulfing_H`, `Hammer_H`, `Gap_Up_H`, and `Gap_Down_H` are <strong>False</strong> [CITE: Break_Up_24H, Break_Down_24H, Vol_Breakout_Up, Vol_Breakout_Down, Bull_Engulfing_H, Hammer_H, Gap_Up_H, Gap_Down_H]. This means that while there was a significant volume event, no specific candlestick patterns or explicit price breakouts (beyond the implied bearishness of the price fall itself) were registered in this latest hour.
