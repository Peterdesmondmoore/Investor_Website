        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bearish Short/Medium-Term Trend:</strong> The current Close (<span class="data-point">25.440001</span>) is trading below the SMA_20H (<span class="data-point">25.918</span>), SMA_50H (<span class="data-point">25.8664</span>), EMA_20H (<span class="data-point">25.682654</span>), and EMA_50H (<span class="data-point">25.690700</span>). The EMA_20H is also below EMA_50H, indicating a short-term bearish bias ["SMA_20H", "SMA_50H", "EMA_20H", "EMA_50H"].</li>
            <li><strong>Bearish Momentum:</strong> The MACD (<span class="data-point">-0.139974</span>) is below its Signal line (<span class="data-point">-0.050886</span>), and MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">-0.089088</span>) is negative, confirming bearish momentum ["MACD", "MACD_Signal", "MACD_Hist"].</li>
            <li><strong>Downtrending Bias with Low Strength:</strong> The DI-_14H (<span class="data-point">30.116925</span>) is higher than DI+_14H (<span class="data-point">19.800484</span>), suggesting sellers have the upper hand. However, the ADX_14H (<span class="data-point">20.182078</span>) is below 25, indicating a weak or non-trending market ["ADX_14H", "DI+_14H", "DI-_14H"].</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Bullish Resilience:</strong> Despite recent weakness, the current price remains above the EMA_200H (<span class="data-point">24.606124</span>), suggesting the underlying long-term trend is still positive ["EMA_200H"].</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral RSI:</strong> The RSI_14H at <span class="data-point">44.682125</span> is in neutral territory, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions ["RSI_14H"].</li>
            <li><strong>Within Range Trading:</strong> The instrument closed at <span class="data-point">25.440001</span>, trading between its 24H Support (<span class="data-point">25.059999</span>) and Resistance (<span class="data-point">26.620001</span>) levels ["Res_24H", "Sup_24H"].</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neutral Stance Advised:</strong> The `Signal` is `0`, indicating a neutral market stance. Traders should exercise caution and avoid aggressive directional bets until a clearer trend emerges ["Signal"].</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor for Trend Reversal:</strong> Given the long-term bullish EMA_200H, traders could look for bullish reversal signals if the price approaches the 24H Support (<span class="data-point">25.059999</span>) or decisively crosses above short-term moving averages ["EMA_200H", "Sup_24H"].</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm Breakouts:</strong> As no active breakout signals are present, waiting for a confirmed break above resistance or below support, ideally with strong volume, is prudent before taking new positions ["Break_Up_24H", "Break_Down_24H"].</li>
            <li><strong>Volatility Awareness:</strong> The Bollinger Band Width (<span class="data-point">0.075342</span>) indicates notable volatility. While currently in a range, strong moves can occur quickly, so appropriate risk management is essential ["BB_Width"].</li>
        </ul>
