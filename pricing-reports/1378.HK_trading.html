        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The instrument exhibits **short-to-medium term bearish momentum** within a broader **long-term bullish trend**. Price is consolidating below key short-term moving averages, yet strongly supported by the long-term EMA_200H. Momentum and directional indicators confirm a current bearish bias lacking strong trending conviction.

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bearish Short/Medium-term Trend:</strong> Current Close (<span class="data-point">25.44</span>) trades below its 20-hour SMA (<span class="data-point">25.92</span>) and EMA (<span class="data-point">25.68</span>), and 50-hour SMA (<span class="data-point">25.87</span>) and EMA (<span class="data-point">25.69</span>), confirming short/medium-term bearish bias.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term Support Intact:</strong> Price remains well above the 200-hour EMA (<span class="data-point">24.61</span>), indicating the underlying long-term bullish trend is protected.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative Momentum:</strong> MACD (<span class="data-point">-0.14</span>) below its Signal Line (<span class="data-point">-0.05</span>) with negative MACD_Hist (<span class="data-point">-0.09</span>) signifies accelerating bearish momentum.</li>
            <li><strong>Developing Bearish Direction:</strong> ADX_14H (<span class="data-point">20.18</span>) suggests a developing trend, with DI- (<span class="data-point">30.12</span>) dominant over DI+ (<span class="data-point">19.80</span>), indicating growing bearish control.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral Volatility and RSI:</strong> Bollinger Bands show price contained, and RSI_14H at <span class="data-point">44.68</span> is neutral, not signaling immediate overbought/oversold.</li>
            <li><strong>Intraday Buying Pressure:</strong> Current Close (<span class="data-point">25.44</span>) is marginally above the daily VWAP (<span class="data-point">25.41</span>), suggesting some buying interest today.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monitor for Reversal:</strong> Watch for a decisive break above short-term MAs (e.g., EMA_20H at <span class="data-point">25.68</span>) or 24H Resistance (<span class="data-point">26.62</span>) to signal a potential shift in sentiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Entry:</strong> A retest of strong long-term support at EMA_200H (<span class="data-point">24.61</span>) could offer an attractive entry for long-term buyers if it holds.</li>
            <li><strong>Short-Term Resistance:</strong> The cluster of short-term moving averages around <span class="data-point">25.68</span> - <span class="data-point">25.92</span> will act as immediate resistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Caution for Aggressive Shorts:</strong> While short-term bearish, strong long-term support at EMA_200H warrants caution for aggressive short selling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Signal Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="signal-box">
            <p><strong>Signal: <span class="data-point">0</span> (Neutral)</strong></p>
            <p>
                This indicates that aggregated technical indicators do not present a clear bullish or bearish advantage, suggesting a balanced market or consolidation phase.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            For the latest hourly snapshot, all boolean flags (e.g., <code>Break_Up_24H</code>, <code>Vol_Spike</code>, <code>Bull_Engulfing_H</code>) are <span class="data-point">False</span>. This confirms the absence of immediate strong directional breakouts, significant volume events, or reversal candlestick patterns in the latest hourly candle, reinforcing the neutral, consolidating outlook.
