    <h3>1) Executive Summary (≤ 120 words)</h3>
    <p data-bind="exec_summary">The macroeconomic landscape indicates a disinflationary slowdown with increasing labor market slack and elevated financial fragility. Core inflation signals are cooling, and longer-term expectations are easing. The labor market is softening across multiple indicators, nearing 'COOL' regimes in composition and weekly hours. While M2 liquidity shows expansion from RRP unwinds, a steepening yield curve and elevated financial stress point to growing risks. Consumer sentiment remains deeply bearish. The weakening USD provides a counter-cyclical tailwind. This necessitates a cautious stance, favoring defensive assets over cyclicals, with duration performing well amid easing inflation pressures.</p>

    <h3>3) Dominant Themes</h3>
    <ul data-bind="themes_list">
      <li>Persistent Disinflationary Drift: US Inflation signal is COOL, and longer-term market inflation expectations are cooling, suggesting reduced pricing pressures.</li>
      <li>Labor Market Deceleration: Multiple labor indicators point to increasing slack, softening demand, and declining worker confidence.</li>
      <li>Growing Financial Fragility: Elevated financial stress and widening credit spreads suggest increasing risk aversion despite short-term market calm.</li>
      <li>Mixed Growth Momentum: While core manufacturing orders show strength, broader industrial activity and employment breadth indicate patchy and decelerating growth.</li>
      <li>Accommodative Liquidity: Fed's liquidity posture remains expansionary, largely driven by RRP unwinds, providing a supportive backdrop.</li>

    <ul data-bind="crosslinks_bullets">
      <li>Easing liquidity (M2, Fed Liquidity) combined with cooling inflation (US Inflation, MIIE) and softening labor (LMT, Turnover) generally supports bonds and duration.</li>
      <li>Weakening USD (USD Index) and decelerating growth indicators (Weekly Hours, Sectoral Employment) imply headwinds for cyclicals and a preference for quality in equities.</li>
      <li>Elevated financial stress (FSI) and widening credit spreads (Credit Spreads) despite calm short-term volatility (VIX) suggest underlying market fragility that could lead to risk-off episodes.</li>
      <li>Bearish consumer sentiment (UMich) coupled with increasing labor market slack (Employment Composition) poses downside risks to consumption and broad economic growth.</li>

      <li><strong>Bonds/Duration:</strong> <span data-bind="imp_bonds">Overweight, supported by cooling inflation and increasing labor market slack, which could lead to dovish central bank shifts (per Inflation, Labor, Rates/Yield Curve).</span></li>
      <li><strong>Credit:</strong> <span data-bind="imp_credit">Underweight, as widening credit spreads and elevated financial stress suggest increasing default risk and reduced appetite for corporate debt (per Credit, FSI).</span></li>
      <li><strong>FX (USD):</strong> <span data-bind="imp_fx">Underweight, with a weakening trend that generally supports commodity currencies and other major crosses (per FX).</span></li>
      <li><strong>Commodities/Metals:</strong> <span data-bind="imp_commodities">Mixed; precious metals could see safe-haven demand (per FSI, UMich), while industrial metals face headwinds from mixed industrial production (per Growth, Credit).</span></li>

    <h3>8) Risk Checks &amp; Contradictions</h3>
    <ul data-bind="risk_checks">
      <li>Liquidity vs. Real Economy: Strong liquidity signals (M2, RRP unwinds) contradict weakening real economy signals (Labor slack, Growth deceleration, UMich Bearish), indicating a potential disconnect.</li>
      <li>VIX Calm vs. FSI Elevated: Short-term market volatility (VIX) being calm contrasts with elevated broader financial stress (FSI), implying hidden risks or complacency.</li>
      <li>Durable Goods Strength vs. Broader Growth: Bullish Durable Goods ex-Trans suggests resilient core manufacturing, but other growth indicators are patchy or softening, creating ambiguity in overall economic momentum.</li>
      <li>Yield Curve Steepening vs. Disinflation: A steepening yield curve (Bearish signal) can imply future inflation or policy normalization, which somewhat contradicts the prevailing disinflationary signals.</li>
      <li>Lagged Data: Job Flows (Q4 2024) and some Wage Growth data (Apr 2025) are significantly lagged, potentially misrepresenting the most current state of the labor market.</li>
