            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>
                Overall market sentiment, derived from the latest Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for September 2025, is moderately bearish. The headline PMI registered 49.8, continuing a trend of sub-50 readings over recent months, indicating a contraction in China's manufacturing activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Industrial Metals, the outlook appears bearish. The new order sub-index consistently remained significantly below 50 (46.0 in September), signaling weakening demand. Concurrently, the raw material inventory index also trended below 50, suggesting a reluctance among firms to build stocks and potential drawdowns, further undermining demand prospects for industrial metals.
            </p>
            <p>
                For China Equities, the environment suggests a moderately bearish outlook. The sustained contraction in the overall PMI, coupled with a sharp decline in new orders and employment (45.0 in September), indicates persistent challenges in both domestic and international demand, alongside a deteriorating labor market. While production mostly remained in expansionary territory, the weakness in key demand and labor components points to potential headwinds for corporate earnings and overall economic growth, posing risks to equity performance.
