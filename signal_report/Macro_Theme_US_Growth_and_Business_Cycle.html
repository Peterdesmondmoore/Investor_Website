<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The current US growth and business cycle narrative reflects a mixed-signal environment. While core manufacturing demand demonstrates a resilient, Bullish trend, overall capital expenditure intent remains Neutral following periods of significant volatility. Real-economy activity, as indicated by industrial production, is also assessed as Neutral, showing modest growth tempered by strong supply-side factors.</p>
<p>Financial market signals from the yield curve present a nuanced picture. The Treasury curve relative to Fed Funds is Bullish (inverted/flat), a historically cautionary stance, yet the broader yield curve slope composite indicates a Flat/Neutral regime, characteristic of a mature economic cycle with balanced pressures.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Capex direction: Capex Intent is Neutral, following notable swings between Expansion and Contraction, suggesting a phase of indecision or stabilization in business investment.</li>
  <li>Manufacturing / durables conditions: Core manufacturing demand, proxied by Durable Goods ex-Transportation, is Bullish, driven by recent short-term momentum.</li>
  <li>Industrial production trend: Industrial Production is Neutral, with modest year-over-year growth that, combined with strong mining sector activity, prevents a Bullish classification.</li>
  <li>Yield-curve positioning: The GS10-FEDFUNDS spread is Bullish (flat/inverted), while the Yield Curve Slope Composite is Flat/Neutral, indicating differing interpretations of curve dynamics.</li>
  <li>Overall growth risk bias: The environment suggests resilient pockets within manufacturing, but overall growth momentum is tempered, with yield curve signals reflecting either late-cycle maturity or historical recessionary precursors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Business Investment &amp; Capex Intent</h3>
<p>The Capex Intent composite signal is currently in a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime, recorded at 0.14 as of September 30, 2025. This position indicates stable durable goods order momentum, consistent with a baseline pace of business investment.</p>
<p>The signal has experienced significant volatility in recent months. It moved from an <strong>Expansion</strong> regime at 4.98 in May 2025 to a <strong>Contraction</strong> regime at -1.55 in August 2025. This abrupt shift highlights recent extreme fluctuations in capital expenditure momentum.</p>
<p>The current Neutral classification suggests that corporate investment appetite is indecisive or in a phase of re-evaluation following these sharp movements, lacking a definitive expansionary or contractionary trend.</p>

<h3>2. Core Manufacturing Demand: Durable Goods ex-Transportation</h3>
<p>The Durable Goods ex-Transportation signal indicates a <strong>Bullish</strong> regime as of September 30, 2025. This assessment is primarily driven by a 3-month percentage change of +1.92%, which surpasses the +1% threshold for a Bullish classification.</p>
<p>Year-over-year growth for this component stands at +3.07%. While positive, this rate is below the +5% year-over-year threshold typically required to independently trigger a Bullish signal based solely on long-term momentum.</p>
<p>This signal, which isolates core manufacturing demand by excluding the often-volatile transportation sector, suggests a firming trend and sustained positive momentum in underlying durable goods orders.</p>

<h3>3. Real-Economy Activity: Industrial Production</h3>
<p>The Industrial Production signal is currently classified as <strong>Neutral</strong> as of August 1, 2025. The year-over-year industrial production growth (INDPRO_YoY) is recorded at +0.84%, which is below the +3% threshold necessary for a Bullish signal.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the mining share of GDP year-over-year (RIWG21222S_YoY) exhibits significant positive growth at +39.66%. The methodology for this signal requires positive industrial production growth to be accompanied by a non-rising (zero or negative) mining share for a Bullish classification.</p>
<p>Consequently, despite positive, albeit modest, industrial production growth, the robust expansion in the mining sector prevents a Bullish reading, resulting in a Neutral assessment that points towards demand stagnation rather than a strong recovery in real economy activity.</p>

<h3>4. Yield-Curve Signals</h3>
<p>The Treasury curve, as measured by the GS10-FEDFUNDS spread, is in a <strong>Bullish</strong> regime as of October 1, 2025. The yield spread is -0.03%, reflecting a flat to inverted curve condition. According to the signal's methodology, a spread less than or equal to 0% is classified as Bullish, which, in a risk-asset orientation, may imply a restrictive monetary stance or forward-growth stress.</p>
<p>Conversely, the broader Yield Curve Slope Composite, which averages normalized 10Y-2Y and 10Y-3M spreads, is in a <strong>Flat/Neutral</strong> regime as of November 30, 2025. The composite score of 0.367 indicates a late-cycle balance between growth and inflation pressures, absent extreme steepening or inversion.</p>
<p>These two yield curve diagnostics offer contrasting perspectives: the GS10-FEDFUNDS spread indicates a policy-driven environment that has historically preceded economic slowdowns, while the composite slope signal suggests a more balanced, albeit mature, phase of the economic cycle.</p>

<h3>5. Synthesised US Growth &amp; Cycle Assessment</h3>
<p>The current US growth and business cycle environment is characterized by a divergence in momentum across real economy indicators and mixed signals from financial markets. Core manufacturing demand demonstrates a Bullish trend, reflecting firm underlying activity, yet broader business investment sentiment remains Neutral, impacted by recent volatility.</p>
<p>Industrial production also registers as Neutral, with modest growth constrained by a strong supply-side component in the mining sector. Yield curve signals offer differing interpretations: the GS10-FEDFUNDS spread is Bullish, historically associated with restrictive policy and potential economic stress, while the composite yield curve slope is Flat/Neutral, indicative of a mature cycle phase. This triangulation of signals suggests an environment that is neither strongly expansive nor contracting, but rather in a state of "Resilient Late-Cycle" where some sectors maintain momentum amidst broader uncertainty and cautionary financial indicators.</p>

<h3>6. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A sustained acceleration in core manufacturing demand could broaden into stronger overall business investment, potentially driving the Capex Intent signal into an Expansion regime.</li>
  <li>Any normalization of the yield curve, particularly a steepening that is not driven by inflation expectations, could signal improving longer-term growth prospects.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Continued volatility or a retrenchment in durable goods orders could lead to a contraction in overall business investment appetite, pushing the Capex Intent signal into a Bearish regime.</li>
  <li>Should Industrial Production growth fail to accelerate and the strong contribution from the mining sector normalize, it could indicate a manufacturing stall speed or broader economic deceleration.</li>
  <li>The persistent flat or inverted state of the GS10-FEDFUNDS spread maintains a historical indicator of elevated recession risk, especially if combined with further softening in real activity data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>A macroeconomic environment characterized by resilient core manufacturing alongside tempered broader activity and conflicting yield curve signals typically implies a period necessitating selective asset allocation. This regime may favor assets with defensive characteristics or those with strong idiosyncratic growth drivers over broad cyclical exposures, given the absence of a clear and accelerating growth trend.</p>
<p>Risk appetite may remain cautious as market participants reconcile pockets of strength with broader economic uncertainties and mixed financial indicators. Credit conditions could become more sensitive to shifts in monetary policy expectations or real activity data, particularly if yield curve inversion persists. Assets with higher rates sensitivity might experience increased volatility in response to any repricing of future interest rate paths.</p></div></section>
