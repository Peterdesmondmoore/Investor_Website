  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><p><em>Synthesising capex, production, durables, housing, Beige Book conditions and yield-curve signals.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The current US business cycle is characterised by a late-cycle deceleration, with underlying elements of core manufacturing strength facing broad-based headwinds. Real activity exhibits a mixed trajectory; while core durable goods orders show momentum, overall capex intent remains neutral. Industrial production indicates moderate growth constrained by supply-side dynamics, and the housing market is in a neutral, decelerating phase. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book characterises national conditions as "largely unchanged" with a "slight deterioration in the overall growth distribution," noting "consumer spending declined further" but "manufacturing activity, in contrast, saw a modest increase."</p>
<p>This synthesis points to a resilient yet decelerating economy, where softening demand and tightening credit are emerging risks, potentially moving towards a stall-speed scenario without immediate signs of severe contraction.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Capex Direction:</strong> Neutral, reflecting volatility in investment trends after recent expansion and contraction phases.</li>
  <li><strong>Durables Conditions:</strong> Bullish, driven by firming core manufacturing demand and robust near-term momentum.</li>
  <li><strong>Industrial Production Trend:</strong> Neutral, with moderate demand growth offset by significant supply-side expansion.</li>
  <li><strong>Yield-Curve State:</strong> The GS10-FEDFUNDS spread is Bearish (steepening), indicating a shift from inversion, while the composite 10Y-2Y/10Y-3M slope is Flat/Neutral.</li>
  <li><strong>Beige Book Signals:</strong> Regional demand patterns are softening, labor markets are easing with improved availability but persistent cost pressures, and credit conditions are tightening with decreasing loan demand.</li>
  <li><strong>Overall Growth Risk Bias:</strong> Leaning towards a downside bias due to broad-based demand weakening, tightening credit, and recent yield curve steepening signals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Business Investment &amp; Capex Intent</h3>
<p>The Capex Intent composite signal is currently in a Neutral regime as of September 30, 2025. This follows a period of significant volatility, including an Expansion phase in May 2025 and a subsequent Contraction in August 2025. This fluctuation suggests short-term uncertainty in business investment momentum, with no clear sustained expansion or contraction presently indicated by total durable goods orders.</p>
<p>The Beige Book notes businesses' "continued hesitation on long-term capital investments due to uncertainty," aligning with the neutral and volatile quantitative signal. Despite this, some targeted spending on automation and AI infrastructure was observed.</p>

<h3>2. Core Manufacturing Demand: Durable Goods ex-Transportation</h3>
<p>The Durable Goods ex-Transportation signal is currently Bullish as of September 30, 2025. This is supported by a year-over-year growth of 3.09% and a 3-month momentum of 1.93%. The bullish classification is primarily driven by the robust near-term momentum, reflecting firming order books in core manufacturing excluding volatile transportation components.</p>
<p>This positive momentum is reinforced by the Beige Book, which reported a "modest increase" in manufacturing activity, specifically noting "Durable goods" and "fabricated metals" as areas of strength.</p>

<h3>3. Real-Economy Activity: Industrial Production</h3>
<p>Industrial Production currently signals a Neutral regime as of September 1, 2025. Year-over-year industrial production growth stands at 1.62%, indicating moderate expansion. However, this growth falls below the 3% bullish threshold. The signal is tempered by a significant year-over-year increase in the mining share of GDP (40.32%), which, while positive, contributes to a neutral overall assessment given the signal's demand-versus-supply framing.</p>
<p>The Beige Book notes "manufacturing activity, in contrast, saw a modest increase," aligning with the moderate positive momentum in industrial output, albeit with the nuance of rising supply-side factors.</p>

<h3>4. Yield-Curve Signals</h3>
<p>The Treasury curve relative to the Fed Funds rate, specifically the GS10-FEDFUNDS spread, is currently classified as Bearish as of November 1, 2025. This is due to the current yield spread of 0.21% exceeding its 3-month moving average trend of 0.027%, indicating a steepening of the curve. This marks a shift from a prolonged period of curve inversion that previously suggested a Bullish regime.</p>
<p>In contrast, the broader Yield Curve Slope composite (10Y-2Y and 10Y-3M spreads) maintained a Flat/Neutral regime throughout 2025, with its latest composite value at 0.545655 as of December 31, 2025. This suggests balanced growth and inflation pressures within a neutral range, without extremes of steepening or deep inversion. The steepening of GS10-FEDFUNDS can be interpreted as indicative of shifting policy expectations or increased risk aversion, which partially contradicts the more balanced signal from the composite slope and suggests a cautious outlook despite the broader neutral slope.</p>

<h3>5. Beige Book Conditions</h3>
<p>The November 2025 Beige Book summary indicates that overall economic activity was "largely unchanged" but observed a "slight deterioration in the overall growth distribution." Business sentiment reflects continued cost pressures and uncertainty impacting long-term capital investments, though some targeted spending on automation and AI infrastructure is present.</p>
<p>Regional demand patterns show "consumer spending declined further nationally," with low- and middle-income consumers becoming more cautious. Loan demand "decreased overall," and credit standards "tightened" for business and commercial real estate loans, contributing to a "slightly pessimistic outlook" in some districts. Labour markets experienced a "slight decline" in employment and "softer labor demand," with improved worker availability but persistent challenges in specific skilled positions. Pricing pressures "increased moderately," a slight easing from the prior report, but input costs remained "robust and widespread," driven by tariffs, insurance, and healthcare expenses. These conditions broadly suggest decelerating economic momentum with tightening financial conditions, consistent with a late-cycle environment experiencing increasing headwinds to aggregate demand.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesised US Growth &amp; Cycle Assessment</h3>
<p>The current US growth and cycle assessment is characterised by a complex interplay of signals. While core manufacturing demand, as indicated by Durable Goods ex-Transportation, shows a bullish trend, broader capital expenditure intent is neutral and industrial production growth is moderate amid rising supply-side factors. The housing market is decelerating into a neutral state, reflecting weakness in permits and slowing starts. The Treasury yield curve (GS10-FEDFUNDS) has shifted to a bearish, steepening signal, suggesting an unwinding of prior inversion and potential forward growth stress or future policy tightening. This contrasts with the broader yield curve slope composite (10Y-2Y, 10Y-3M), which remains in a flat/neutral regime, indicating no immediate, extreme imbalances.</p>
<p>The Beige Book's qualitative insights reinforce a picture of softening aggregate demand, particularly consumer spending, alongside easing labor market tightness but persistent input cost pressures and tightening credit conditions. Cumulatively, these signals point to a dominant cycle regime of a <strong>Late-Cycle Deceleration with Emerging Headwinds</strong>. Growth is positive but losing momentum, with increasing fragility in demand and financial conditions, while some structural positives like manufacturing orders and AI investments persist.</p>

<h3>6. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sustained acceleration in core durable goods orders extending to broader capital expenditure.</li>
  <li>Industrial production re-accelerating beyond current moderate rates, indicating stronger underlying demand.</li>
  <li>Yield curve normalisation without further steepening, signalling improved long-term economic expectations.</li>
  <li>Beige Book commentary indicating a broad-based improvement in consumer demand or easing of labor supply constraints.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Widespread retrenchment in business capital expenditure beyond current volatility.</li>
  <li>Core manufacturing demand (durables ex-transport) entering a sustained stall speed or contraction.</li>
  <li>Renewed policy tightening leading to further curve inversion or sustained steepening reflecting severe economic stress.</li>
  <li>Beige Book deterioration in credit availability, loan demand, or a more pronounced slowdown in aggregate demand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The synthesised growth regime of "Late-Cycle Deceleration with Emerging Headwinds" suggests a market environment where broad risk appetite may become increasingly selective and sensitive to macroeconomic data. While sectors tied to core manufacturing and targeted AI infrastructure investments may demonstrate pockets of resilience, a cautious stance on economically sensitive assets generally appears warranted.</p>
<p>Credit conditions are expected to remain under scrutiny, particularly for consumer and business segments facing tightening standards and deteriorating loan performance. This environment exhibits characteristics of decelerating momentum alongside elements of fragility, requiring a nuanced approach that prioritises quality and defensiveness over outright pro-cyclical exposure.</p></div></section>
