<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The current US growth and business cycle assessment indicates a late-cycle environment characterized by mixed real activity signals and persistent yield curve inversion or flatness. Core manufacturing shows positive momentum, providing some resilience, while broader industrial activity and investment intent are either neutral or have recently normalized after periods of volatility.</p>
<p>Yield curve diagnostics present a nuanced picture, with the policy-sensitive spread reflecting restrictive conditions, while the broader composite slope remains neutral, suggesting a balance in long-term expectations rather than an accelerating growth outlook.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Capex Intent:</strong> Currently in a Neutral regime, following a recent contraction in August and prior expansionary phases, indicating a normalization of corporate investment appetite with recent volatility.</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing / Durables:</strong> The Durable Goods ex-Transportation signal is Bullish, driven by firm short-term order momentum, suggesting underlying strength in core manufacturing demand.</li>
  <li><strong>Industrial Production:</strong> Remains in a Neutral regime, reflecting modest year-over-year growth that is offset by significant expansion in the mining sector.</li>
  <li><strong>Yield Curve vs Fed Funds:</strong> Indicates a Bullish signal due to a flat-to-inverted spread, traditionally associated with restrictive monetary policy or decelerating growth expectations.</li>
  <li><strong>Yield Curve Slope:</strong> The composite slope remains in a Flat/Neutral regime, with spreads within historical neutral thresholds, suggesting no extreme long-term steepening or inversion.</li>
  <li><strong>Housing:</strong> The Housing Lead indicator is Neutral (as of August 2025), reflecting weak permits juxtaposed with slightly above-median housing starts and normalized mortgage rates.</li>
  <li><strong>Overall Growth Bias:</strong> The aggregate signals point to continued growth moderation within a late-cycle context, with pockets of strength in core demand but overall caution from financial conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Business Investment &amp; Capex Intent</h3>
<p>The Capex Intent signal is currently in a Neutral regime, registered at 0.137 as of September 30, 2025. This follows a period of significant volatility, including a Contraction regime in August 2025 with a value of -1.547, and an earlier Expansion regime in May 2025 at 4.979.</p>
<p>The recent transition reflects a normalization of corporate investment appetite. The sharp deceleration in August was particularly notable, with the 3-month annualised growth of durable goods orders showing an extreme z-score of -3.57, indicating a significant unwind of previous positive momentum in capital expenditure intentions.</p>

<h3>2. Core Manufacturing Demand: Durable Goods ex-Transportation</h3>
<p>The Durable Goods ex-Transportation signal is currently Bullish, as of September 30, 2025. This classification is primarily driven by strong near-term order flow, evidenced by a 3-month percentage change of 1.92%, which exceeds the +1% bullish threshold.</p>
<p>Year-over-year growth for this component stands at 3.07%, with a robust z-score of 0.18, suggesting positive momentum that is not indicative of extreme market positioning or significant crowding. This signal emphasizes firm core manufacturing demand, excluding the inherent volatility from the transportation sector.</p>

<h3>3. Real-Economy Activity: Industrial Production</h3>
<p>Industrial Production is currently in a Neutral regime, as of August 1, 2025. This classification arises from a year-over-year growth rate of 0.84% for industrial production, which is below the +3% threshold required for a Bullish signal.</p>
<p>Despite modest overall growth, the mining share of GDP exhibited a substantial year-over-year increase of 39.66%. The coexistence of moderate industrial production growth and robust mining expansion prevents a Bullish classification by the signal's defined rules, reflecting a mixed picture for broader real-economy activity.</p>

<h3>4. Yield-Curve Signals</h3>
<p>The yield curve diagnostics present differentiated insights into financial conditions and growth expectations.</p>
<p>The Treasury curve relative to the Fed Funds rate (GS10-FEDFUNDS) is in a Bullish regime, with a spread of -0.03% as of October 1, 2025. This inverted or flat spread has persisted for three consecutive months (August-October 2025), following a brief Bearish signal in June 2025 due to steepening momentum. This Bullish signal for risk assets traditionally reflects restrictive monetary policy settings or an anticipation of slowing economic growth.</p>
<p>In contrast, the composite yield curve slope, derived from 10Y-2Y and 10Y-3M spreads, is in a Flat/Neutral regime, with a composite value of 0.367 as of November 30, 2025. Both underlying spreads (0.55 for 10Y-2Y and 0.14 for 10Y-3M) are positive but remain within the defined neutral thresholds. This indicates that long-term growth and inflation expectations, as reflected in the broader term structure, are currently balanced without extreme steepening or deep inversion.</p>

<h3>5. Synthesised US Growth &amp; Cycle Assessment</h3>
<p>The aggregate of investment, production, demand, and yield curve signals points to a continued environment of growth moderation within a late-cycle context. While core manufacturing exhibits positive momentum, broader business investment intent has normalized after periods of volatility, and industrial production maintains a neutral stance with contributions from the mining sector. The yield curve signals offer a mixed interpretation: an inverted/flat curve versus Fed Funds suggests persistent policy restrictiveness, while the composite slope remains balanced. Housing activity is neutral, reflecting offsetting factors.</p>
<p>This constellation indicates that while certain segments of the economy show resilience, overall growth dynamics are not robustly expanding, and financial conditions, as interpreted by parts of the yield curve, remain cautious regarding the forward economic trajectory.</p>

<h3>6. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sustained and broadening positive momentum in core manufacturing, as indicated by Durable Goods ex-Transportation, could translate into more robust overall industrial activity and business investment.</li>
  <li>A definitive and sustained steepening of the yield curve from its current neutral/inverted state could signal an improvement in long-term growth expectations and reduced policy restrictiveness.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A renewed contraction in Capex Intent, particularly if the recent normalization in durable goods orders reverses towards a negative trend.</li>
  <li>Stagnation or a return to negative year-over-year growth in Industrial Production, especially if the current robust growth in the mining component wanes.</li>
  <li>Persistent inversion or further flattening of the yield curve, signaling continued restrictive monetary policy pressure and heightened recessionary concerns.</li>
  <li>A deterioration in housing permits and starts, leading to a "Contracting" regime for the Housing Lead indicator, would signify broader economic weakness.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>This mixed growth regime, characterized by robust core manufacturing juxtaposed with neutral broader industrial activity and normalized investment intent, typically favors selective cyclical exposures over broad-market cyclicals. Persistent yield curve inversion or flatness suggests ongoing caution regarding the long-term growth outlook and implications for credit quality.</p>
<p>In such an environment, risk appetite may become more discerning, prioritizing companies with strong balance sheets and resilient demand. Sensitive rates exposures may remain volatile, reflecting evolving monetary policy expectations and their influence on the short end of the curve, while credit conditions may experience tightening in the context of restrictive policy.</p></div></section>
