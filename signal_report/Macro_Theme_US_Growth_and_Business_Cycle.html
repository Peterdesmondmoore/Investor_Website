  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><p><em>Synthesising capex, production, durables, and yield-curve signals.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The US growth and business cycle signals present a mixed but predominantly neutral picture, transitioning from recent volatility in capital expenditure and manufacturing. Real-economy activity remains in a neutral growth phase, with moderate industrial production growth balanced by a high mining share. Financial market indicators from the yield curve reflect a policy-influenced flat/inverted environment, though the broader curve slope remains neutral.</p>
<p>The overall assessment suggests a market state characterised by stabilisation after prior growth swings, with continued policy-driven influences on the yield curve. Core manufacturing demand shows positive momentum, providing some support to the outlook for real activity.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Capex intent has reverted to a Neutral regime after periods of both expansion and contraction.</li>
  <li>Core manufacturing demand, as indicated by durable goods ex-transportation, is currently Bullish.</li>
  <li>Industrial Production remains in a Neutral regime, with growth below the bullish threshold and a rising mining share.</li>
  <li>The Treasury curve relative to Fed Funds indicates a Bullish regime, reflecting an inverted or flat policy stance.</li>
  <li>The broader yield curve slope composite is in a Flat/Neutral regime, suggesting balanced market expectations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Business Investment &amp; Capex Intent</h3>
<p>The Capex Intent signal is currently in a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime, with a composite score of 0.14 as of September 30, 2025. This follows a period of significant volatility in business investment appetite, where the signal registered an 'Expansion' regime with a value of 4.98 in May 2025, and subsequently a 'Contraction' regime with a value of -1.55 in August 2025.</p>
<p>The latest reading indicates a pause or stabilisation in corporate investment momentum, as year-over-year durable goods orders stand at approximately 7.24% and three-month annualised growth is 2.45%. The composite is currently derived solely from total durable goods orders (DGORDER), as the preferred ex-transportation series was not utilized in this instance.</p>

<h3>2. Core Manufacturing Demand: Durable Goods ex-Transportation</h3>
<p>Core manufacturing demand, measured by the Durable Goods ex-Transportation signal, is currently in a <strong>Bullish</strong> regime as of September 30, 2025. This classification is primarily driven by the recent three-month percentage change in orders, which stands at 1.92%, exceeding the +1% bullish threshold.</p>
<p>Year-over-year growth in durable goods ex-transportation orders is 3.07%. While this rate does not meet the higher +5% threshold for a bullish classification on its own, the positive short-term momentum provides support for the overall bullish signal. The robust YoY z-score of 0.18 indicates moderate, sustained positive momentum in core manufacturing activity.</p>

<h3>3. Real-Economy Activity: Industrial Production</h3>
<p>The Industrial Production signal is in a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime as of August 1, 2025. Year-over-year Industrial Production (INDPRO_YoY) is 0.84%, which is below the +3% threshold required for a 'Bullish' classification. Concurrently, the year-over-year growth in the mining share of GDP (RIWG21222S_YoY) is 39.66%.</p>
<p>The persistent positive growth in the mining share, exceeding 0%, in conjunction with industrial production growth below 3%, prevents a 'Bullish' classification per the signal's methodology. The regime transitioned from 'Bearish' throughout 2024 to 'Neutral' in early 2025, suggesting a stabilised but not robust demand environment.</p>

<h3>4. Yield-Curve Signals</h3>
<p>The yield curve signals offer insights into monetary policy stance and market growth expectations.</p>
<p>The Treasury curve relative to the Fed Funds rate (GS10-FEDFUNDS) is in a <strong>Bullish</strong> regime as of October 1, 2025. The Yield Spread between the 10-year Treasury and the Effective Federal Funds Rate is -0.03%, reflecting an inverted or flat curve condition. This implies a restrictive monetary policy stance or market expectations of future easing.</p>
<p>The broader yield-curve slope composite (10Y-2Y and 10Y-3M) is in a <strong>Flat/Neutral</strong> regime as of November 30, 2025, with a composite score of 0.367. This indicates a balanced state where the curve is neither significantly steepening nor deeply inverted, suggesting equilibrium between growth and inflation pressures. The component z-scores (Z_T10Y2Y at 0.541 and Z_T10Y3M at 0.194) confirm this non-extreme positioning, consistent with a neutral assessment.</p>

<h3>5. Synthesised US Growth &amp; Cycle Assessment</h3>
<p>The composite view of US growth and business cycle signals indicates a transition towards a more stabilised, albeit moderate, growth environment. Business investment intent has stabilised in a Neutral regime after recent volatility. Core manufacturing shows positive momentum, offering underlying support to economic activity. Industrial production growth remains modest, preventing a clear 'Bullish' real-economy signal.</p>
<p>Financial market signals from the yield curve present a nuanced picture: while the Treasury-Fed Funds spread suggests policy restrictiveness or anticipation of future easing (Bullish), the broader curve slope composite remains neutral. This indicates a late-cycle phase where policy is tight, but long-term growth expectations are not aggressively deteriorating enough to cause significant further inversion, nor are they rapidly improving to induce steepening.</p>

<h3>6. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sustained 'Bullish' momentum in durable goods ex-transportation could translate into broader manufacturing expansion.</li>
  <li>Stabilisation in capex intent, if it firms into 'Expansion', would signal renewed corporate investment.</li>
  <li>Further normalisation or steepening in the yield curve composite, moving away from 'Inverted' or 'Flat/Neutral', could signal improving forward growth expectations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A reversion of durable goods ex-transportation to a 'Neutral' or 'Bearish' regime would indicate softening core manufacturing demand.</li>
  <li>Continued 'Neutral' industrial production with persistent high mining share could indicate supply-side constraints or demand-side weakness.</li>
  <li>A deeper or prolonged inversion of the yield curve (GS10-FEDFUNDS) would reinforce recessionary signals from monetary policy.</li>
  <li>A shift of the yield curve slope composite towards 'Inverted' would imply rising forward growth stress.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The current confluence of signals, indicating a neutral to cautiously positive real activity alongside a policy-constrained yet not deeply inverted yield curve, points to a late-cycle market phase. This environment typically favors a balanced approach, with a discerning focus on quality and earnings resilience.</p>
<p>Asset allocation implications could involve a mix of cyclical exposures supported by manufacturing momentum, balanced by defensive positioning given policy-driven yield curve dynamics. Credit conditions may remain stable but sensitive to policy shifts, while rates sensitivity could become more complex, as the market navigates a potentially sustained 'Flat/Neutral' yield curve amidst ongoing monetary policy watchfulness.</p></div></section>
