<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The US economy presents a complex and evolving landscape, characterized by mixed signals from real activity indicators and financial conditions. Overall business cycle signals suggest a decelerating late-cycle environment with emerging fragility, despite some sectors showing resilience. Economic activity is generally seen as largely unchanged to experiencing a slight net softening nationally.</p>
<p>While core manufacturing demand shows momentum, broader industrial production remains modest, and investment intent has been volatile. Housing activity is neutral but faces headwinds. Critically, credit conditions are tightening, and consumer loan delinquencies are rising, indicating potential financial strain. The Treasury yield curve signals suggest conflicting interpretations, with a policy-sensitive spread indicating adverse risk while the structural curve remains neutral.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Capex Direction:</strong> Neutral, following recent volatility between expansion and contraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Durables Conditions:</strong> Bullish, driven by strong short-term momentum in core manufacturing orders.</li>
  <li><strong>Industrial Production Trend:</strong> Neutral, with modest year-over-year growth alongside rising mining sector output.</li>
  <li><strong>Yield-Curve State:</strong> The GS10-FEDFUNDS spread is Bearish, steepening from an inverted state; the T10Y2Y/T10Y3M composite remains Flat/Neutral.</li>
  <li><strong>Beige Book Signals:</strong> Demand is softening with bifurcated consumer spending. Labour markets show easing and AI impact. Pricing pressures are moderate, but input costs are rising, leading to margin compression. Credit conditions are tightening with rising consumer delinquencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Overall Growth Risk Bias:</strong> Leaning towards downside, given deteriorating credit, mixed real activity, and a steepening policy-sensitive yield curve.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Business Investment &amp; Capex Intent</h3>
<p>The Capex Intent composite signal is currently in a Neutral regime as of September 30, 2025. This follows a notable shift from a Contraction regime in August 2025, which itself rapidly unwound from an Expansion regime observed in May 2025. This volatility in durable goods orders indicates rapid changes in capital expenditure momentum, with the current neutral state reflecting a bounce from extreme negative positioning.</p>

<h3>2. Core Manufacturing Demand: Durable Goods ex-Transportation</h3>
<p>Core manufacturing demand, as indicated by Durable Goods ex-Transportation, is in a Bullish regime as of September 30, 2025. This is primarily driven by robust 3-month momentum, which stands at 1.93%, exceeding the +1% bullish threshold. Year-over-year growth is 3.09%, remaining below the higher +5% bullish threshold. This suggests firming demand in core manufacturing activity, a trend that has been consistently observed since June 2025, despite the year-over-year growth not reaching extreme levels.</p>

<h3>3. Real-Economy Activity: Industrial Production</h3>
<p>Industrial production is in a Neutral signal regime as of September 1, 2025. Industrial Production (INDPRO) grew modestly at 1.62% year-over-year, which is below the +3% threshold for a bullish signal. Concurrently, the mining share of GDP (RIWG21222S) recorded a substantial year-over-year increase of 40.32%, indicating significant expansion in primary supply. This neutral classification reflects demand-driven activity that is not robust enough to offset the signal's criteria for strong supply growth, which previously contributed to a persistent Bearish regime through late 2023 and 2024.</p>

<h3>4. Yield-Curve Signals</h3>
<p>The Treasury curve relative to the Fed Funds rate (GS10-FEDFUNDS) is in a Bearish regime as of November 1, 2025. The yield spread of 0.21% has exceeded its 3-month trend of 0.03%, indicating a recent steepening from a prior inverted (Bullish) state in October 2025. This signals potential adverse risk in the policy stance versus business cycle expectations.</p>
<p>Conversely, the broader yield-curve slope composite (T10Y2Y and T10Y3M spreads) remains in a Flat/Neutral regime as of December 31, 2025, with a composite value of 0.519728. This composite has consistently remained within its ±0.75 thresholds throughout 2025, suggesting a balanced state between long-term growth and inflation expectations. The divergence between the policy-sensitive spread and the broader slope composite introduces nuance, with the former contradicting the Beige Book's generally unchanged economic activity by signaling increased adverse risk.</p>

<h3>5. Beige Book Conditions</h3>
<p>The Federal Reserve's Beige Book indicates that national economic activity has largely remained unchanged or softened slightly, with consumer spending declining further, particularly among lower- and middle-income households. High-end retail showed resilience. Manufacturing activity improved somewhat, despite ongoing headwinds from tariffs and associated uncertainty. Nonfinancial services activity was generally flat to down, and conditions in real estate remained mixed, with residential sectors showing more pronounced declines. Credit conditions are tightening, and loan demand is mixed to slightly lower, accompanied by a notable rise in consumer loan delinquencies and defaults, suggesting a deterioration in credit quality.</p>
<p>Labour market conditions show a slight decline in employment levels, easing from prior stability, with weaker demand primarily managed through hiring freezes, attrition, and AI-driven productivity gains rather than widespread layoffs. Wage growth is modest and has moderated slightly. Businesses continue to face moderate price increases due to robust input cost pressures, especially from tariffs, though their ability to pass on these costs varies, leading to margin compression. Sentiment is characterized by increased risks of slower activity, exacerbated by policy disruptions such as the federal government shutdown impacting several regions.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesised US Growth &amp; Cycle Assessment</h3>
<p>The confluence of signals suggests a US growth environment that is currently in a <strong>Decelerating Late-Cycle with Emerging Credit Fragility</strong>. While core manufacturing demand exhibits bullish momentum, indicative of some underlying economic strength, overall industrial production growth remains modest and insufficient to trigger an expansionary signal. Business investment intent, as captured by capex signals, has experienced rapid shifts, settling into a neutral stance after recent volatility. Housing activity, while currently neutral, has shown periods of significant weakening and faces persistent headwinds from elevated mortgage rates and decelerating permits.</p>
<p>The financial backdrop is more concerning: the short-end of the yield curve (GS10-FEDFUNDS) has steepened into a 'Bearish' regime following an inversion, typically signaling adverse risk to growth or policy. This contrasts with the structural yield curve slope, which remains 'Flat/Neutral', suggesting long-term growth and inflation expectations are balanced. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book reinforces these concerns, highlighting a national backdrop of slight softening, declining consumer spending (outside high-end segments), and critically, rising consumer loan delinquencies and tightening credit standards. Labour markets show easing, and business sentiment, while mixed, points to increased risks of slower activity ahead. Together, these indicators suggest a macro state where underlying real activity is losing momentum, credit conditions are deteriorating, and the risks to future growth are increasing.</p>

<h3>6. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sustained acceleration in durable goods orders beyond current short-term momentum, leading to a broader expansion in business investment.</li>
  <li>A re-acceleration of industrial production that moves beyond modest growth, possibly driven by renewed demand or easing supply pressures.</li>
  <li>Normalization of the policy-sensitive yield curve (GS10-FEDFUNDS) without an associated 'Bearish' signal, indicating improved growth expectations.</li>
  <li>Significant improvement in Beige Book reported demand conditions, particularly among broad consumer segments, or a notable easing of labour supply constraints.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside Risks to Growth</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Retrenchment in business capex, with the Capex Intent signal returning to a Contraction regime, signaling a broad slowdown in investment.</li>
  <li>Core manufacturing demand entering a stall speed or outright contraction, as indicated by a Bearish shift in Durable Goods ex-Transportation.</li>
  <li>Further policy tightening or a renewed, sustained inversion of the yield curve, signaling increased recession risk.</li>
  <li>Deterioration in Beige Book reported credit conditions, including an acceleration of consumer and small business delinquencies, or a more pronounced weakening of overall demand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The prevailing macroeconomic regime of decelerating late-cycle with emerging credit fragility implies a nuanced environment for broad risk appetite. While some segments of manufacturing show robust momentum, the aggregate picture points to increasing caution. This setup typically favors defensive positioning or selective exposure to sectors with robust balance sheets and less sensitivity to consumer credit cycles.</p>
<p>Credit conditions are a key sensitivity, with rising consumer delinquencies and tightening lending standards suggesting potential stress for consumer-facing sectors and lower-rated credit. The conflicting signals from the yield curve components — a steepening policy curve implying adverse risk versus a neutral structural curve — warrant careful monitoring, as sustained steepening from inversion often precedes periods of economic stress. This environment emphasizes fragility over momentum, advocating for an analytical stance focused on resilience and potential inflection points rather than broad directional bets.</p></div></section>
