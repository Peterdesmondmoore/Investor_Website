<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
The prevailing US credit environment indicates a state of guarded stability, characterized by a mix of generally benign market-based conditions alongside emerging signals of potential shifts and recovering momentum. While headline credit spread composites and broader credit conditions indexes remain in neutral territory, underlying components reveal nuanced dynamics, including recent widening in high-yield spreads and elevated systemic stress as measured by the STLFSI4. Private credit growth, having decelerated earlier in the year, has returned to a stable regime, largely driven by bank credit momentum.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Credit Spreads:</strong> Currently in a Normal regime, with both High Yield and Investment Grade spreads remaining tight. However, High Yield spreads exhibit positive 3-month annualized momentum, indicating recent widening from previous tight levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Stress:</strong> The Financial Stress Composite is classified as Neutral. This reflects offsetting pressures from elevated systemic stress (STLFSI4) and relatively benign credit spread and yield curve slope conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>Credit Conditions Composite:</strong> The index is in a Neutral regime, having moderated from an Easing stance earlier in 2025. This indicates a funding backdrop that is neither overtly supportive nor restrictive.</li>
  <li><strong>Private Credit Impulse:</strong> The composite is Stable, recovering from a Decelerating phase earlier in the year. This stabilization is primarily driven by total bank credit growth.</li>
  <li><strong>Overall Credit Environment:</strong> A technically neutral stance, with certain sub-components signaling potential unwind risks or underlying systemic vulnerabilities that warrant close monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Credit Spreads</h3>
As of 2025-11-30, the Credit Spreads Composite (CSC) is classified within a <strong>NORMAL</strong> regime. US High Yield (HY) Option-Adjusted Spreads (OAS) stand at 3.00%, while US Corporate Master (IG) OAS is at 0.82%. Both HY and IG spreads are tight relative to their historical distributions, with HY level z-score at -0.627781 and IG level z-score at -0.762020. This historical tightness is further reflected in their low percentile ranks.

Despite the overall Normal regime, a significant shift in momentum is observed in High Yield spreads. The 3-month annualized change in HY spreads registers a robust z-score of 0.695903, corresponding to an approximate 80 basis points increase over the period. This indicates recent material widening in HY spreads from earlier compressed levels, a condition that, based on methodology, typically signals a tightening phase. However, the composite remains explicitly within the Normal classification.

<h3>2. Systemic Financial Stress</h3>
The Financial Stress Composite is currently in a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime, registering a value of 0.045316 as of 2025-11-30. This position falls within the defined range for neutral conditions (between -0.75 and 0.75).

Analysis of the underlying components reveals divergent signals. The St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) shows an elevated z-score of 1.103935, indicating a period of higher systemic tension relative to its historical median. Conversely, the High-Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (Z_HY) and the inverted 10-Year minus 2-Year Treasury Yield Spread (Z_INV) components exhibit z-scores of -0.427091 and -0.540896, respectively, signaling below-median stress from these credit and yield curve segments. The composite's Neutral classification synthesizes these counteracting pressures.

<h3>3. Credit Conditions Composite</h3>
The Credit Conditions Composite index currently stands at -0.292944 as of 2025-11-30, positioning it within a <strong>Neutral</strong> regime. This reading is within the established band of -0.75 to 0.75 for neutral conditions.

The current Neutral status represents a moderation from earlier in 2025, specifically from January when the index was in an Easing regime at -0.904943. The composite has subsequently trended upwards, indicating a shift from an overtly supportive funding environment towards one of greater equilibrium. All component z-scores for HY OAS (-0.343609), BBB OAS (-0.407505), and VIXCLS (0.104912) are near their robust medians, contributing to the composite's overall neutral interpretation of funding conditions.

<h3>4. Private Credit Impulse</h3>
The Private-Credit Impulse composite is assessed as <strong>Stable</strong>, with a value of 0.444793 as of 2025-11-30. This current status signifies a period of steady credit growth momentum, following a deceleration earlier in 2025, which saw the index drop to -1.040809 in January 2025.

For the latest available data as of 2025-11-30, the composite's value is derived solely from the Total Bank Credit (TOTBKCR) component, which itself shows a z-score of 0.444793. While data for Commercial & Industrial Loans (BUSLOANS) and Total Consumer Loans (TOTALSL) are not available for the most recent month, earlier periods in 2025 observed significant deceleration in both components, with TOTALSL registering z-scores below -2.0 in February 2025 and BUSLOANS showing z-scores near -1.0 in Q2 2025. The current Stable regime indicates a stabilization in overall private credit growth, predominantly reflecting the momentum in total bank credit.

<h3>5. Synthesised US Credit Conditions Assessment</h3>
The current US credit environment presents a complex picture of guarded stability, characterized by generally benign market-based credit conditions yet with underlying signals of nascent stress and recovering momentum.

<h3>6. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside / Supportive</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Continued private credit growth, particularly across all components of the Private Credit Impulse.</li>
  <li>Contained equity and credit market volatility, maintaining or further compressing credit spreads.</li>
  <li>Persistently tight credit spreads, reflecting robust corporate health and ample liquidity.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside / Stress</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Renewed and sustained credit spread widening, especially in the High Yield segment, signaling deteriorating credit quality or liquidity.</li>
  <li>A rising Financial Stress Composite, driven by increasing systemic tension (STLFSI4) or re-steepening/inversion of the yield curve.</li>
  <li>A renewed deceleration in private credit growth, indicating reduced economic activity or tightening lending standards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
Current credit conditions suggest a generally neutral risk sentiment, supported by composites indicating stable funding and credit growth. However, the observed momentum in High Yield spread widening, coupled with an elevated systemic stress indicator (STLFSI4), introduces a layer of caution. Default risk is presently implied as low by the absolute levels of credit spreads, but any sustained trend of spread widening would necessitate a re-evaluation of this outlook. Broader growth implications are generally accommodative due to the stable private credit impulse, indicating ongoing, albeit moderate, support for economic activity. However, the underlying tensions from systemic stress measures suggest that macroeconomic headwinds are not entirely dissipated and warrant continuous monitoring for potential shifts in financial market stability and corporate funding costs. No specific investment recommendations are implied by this assessment.</div></section>
