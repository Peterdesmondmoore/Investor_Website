<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The US credit environment is currently assessed as broadly neutral, although underlying indicators suggest emerging pressures. Credit spreads remain tight by historical standards, but recent momentum indicates a shift towards widening. Systemic financial stress is classified as neutral by the composite index, yet an underlying component, the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4), signals bearish conditions.</p>
<p>The Credit Conditions Composite aligns with a neutral stance, having shifted from an easing regime earlier in the year. Private credit growth, represented by the Private Credit Impulse, is stable, reflecting mixed dynamics across its components.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HY &amp; IG spread regimes: Normal, with recent widening momentum from historically tight levels.</li>
  <li>Financial stress state: Neutral (Composite), but Bearish (STLFSI4 component signal).</li>
  <li>Credit Conditions Composite classification: Neutral.</li>
  <li>Private credit impulse direction: Stable, following a period of deceleration.</li>
  <li>Overall credit environment: Broadly Neutral with emerging upward pressure on spreads and some underlying stress indicators.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Credit Spreads</h3>
<p>As of December 31, 2025, the Credit Spreads Composite (CSC) is in a Normal regime, with a z-score of -0.181915. High Yield (HY) Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) stands at 2.88%, and Investment Grade (IG) Corporate Master OAS is 0.80%. Both HY and IG spreads exhibit historically tight positioning, with percentile ranks at 0.0625 and 0.029167 respectively, indicating levels near their 10-year lows.</p>
<p>Despite these tight levels, recent momentum suggests a shift. The 3-month annualised z-scores for both HY (0.518839) and IG (0.546884) spreads are positive, indicating a period of recent widening from previously compressed valuations.</p>

<h3>2. Systemic Financial Stress</h3>
<p>The Financial Stress Composite indicates a Neutral regime, with a value of -0.554332 as of December 31, 2025. Its components, HY OAS z-score (-0.515634) and inverted 10-Year minus 2-Year Treasury Yield Spread z-score (-0.593031), contributed to this neutral assessment for the latest period.</p>
<p>The St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) component was not available for December 2025. However, for November 30, 2025, its z-score within the composite was 0.391392. Separately, the STLFSI4 signal reported a Bearish regime as of November 28, 2025, with a z-score of 0.758135, reflecting elevated stress in that specific indicator. This suggests a divergence, with the broader composite remaining neutral while a key underlying stress indicator points to tighter conditions.</p>

<h3>3. Credit Conditions Composite</h3>
<p>The Credit Conditions Composite is classified as Neutral, with an index value of -0.338469 as of December 31, 2025. This reflects a shift from an Easing regime observed earlier in 2025, which registered a value of -0.904943 in January. The index is composed of robust z-scores of High Yield OAS (-0.472144), BBB OAS (-0.477764), and VIX (-0.094999).</p>
<p>The current neutral reading, while indicating conditions near typical historical ranges, represents an unwind from the extreme easing observed in credit spreads earlier in the year. Equity volatility (VIX) also registered a low z-score, not contributing to significant tightening pressures as of the latest observation.</p>

<h3>4. Private Credit Impulse</h3>
<p>The Private Credit Impulse is in a Stable regime, with a composite value of 0.063971 as of October 31, 2025. This follows a transition from a Decelerating regime observed earlier in 2025.</p>
<p>Analysis of its components reveals mixed momentum: the z-score for 6-month annualised Total Bank Credit growth was positive (0.486081 as of November 30, 2025), while 6-month annualised Commercial & Industrial Loans growth was slightly positive (0.267931 as of October 31, 2025). In contrast, Total Consumer Loans growth showed negative momentum (-0.358519 as of October 31, 2025). This indicates a credit growth environment that is neither strongly accelerating nor rapidly decelerating in aggregate, yet exhibits varying dynamics across different lending categories.</p>

<h3>5. Synthesised US Credit Conditions Assessment</h3>
<p>US credit conditions are currently assessed as broadly neutral, characterized by a delicate balance between tight credit spreads and some underlying, albeit contained, systemic stress. While both the Credit Spreads Composite and the Credit Conditions Composite are in a Neutral regime, the former indicates recent upward pressure on spreads from historically low levels. The Financial Stress Composite also registers as Neutral; however, the independent STLFSI4 signal suggests a Bearish state, highlighting a potential area of divergence requiring monitoring. The Private Credit Impulse, showing a Stable regime, indicates that credit growth is not a significant amplifier of either stress or ease at present, reflecting mixed sector-specific momentum.</p>

<h3>6. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside / Supportive</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Continued or accelerating private credit growth.</li>
  <li>Contained volatility and stable funding conditions.</li>
  <li>Persistently tight spreads and subdued stress readings.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside / Stress</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Spread widening across HY and IG.</li>
  <li>Financial stress composite rising.</li>
  <li>Renewed deceleration or contraction in private credit growth.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The prevailing credit regime implies a generally balanced risk sentiment environment, with corporate funding conditions currently stable. Despite the overall neutral assessment, the observed upward pressure on credit spreads and the divergence in financial stress indicators suggest the potential for a shift in this equilibrium. Default risk background remains largely contained within a normal range, though the recent momentum in spreads warrants close attention for any deterioration in refinancing conditions.</p>
<p>These credit conditions currently align with a late-cycle environment where liquidity is generally available but is showing signs of re-pricing and increased vigilance. This signals a phase where credit markets may become more sensitive to macro shocks or shifts in monetary policy expectations.</p></div></section>
