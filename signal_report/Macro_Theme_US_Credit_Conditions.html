<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>US credit conditions present a mixed and largely neutral outlook, characterized by stable aggregate measures alongside an underlying signal of elevated systemic stress. While corporate bond spreads remain at historically low levels and private credit growth is stable, a key financial stress indicator has moved into a bearish regime. This divergence highlights a nuanced environment that warrants close monitoring of underlying market liquidity and risk appetite dynamics.</p>
<p>The composites for credit conditions and broader financial stress indicate a neutral state, suggesting benign funding conditions. However, the more granular Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) signals elevated stress, contradicting the composite views. Private credit momentum is stable, albeit with some data incompleteness for the latest period, supporting a steady, though not accelerating, credit environment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HY &amp; IG spread regimes: <strong>NORMAL</strong>(<a href="/signals/credit_spreads_composite.html" target="_blank">1</a>)</li>
  <li>Financial stress state: <strong>Neutral</strong> (Composite)(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_composite.html" target="_blank">3</a>) / <strong>Bearish</strong> (STLFSI4 Index)(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_index.html" target="_blank">4</a>)</li>
  <li>Credit Conditions Composite classification: <strong>Neutral</strong>(<a href="/signals/credit_conditions.html" target="_blank">2</a>)</li>
  <li>Private credit impulse direction: <strong>Stable</strong>(<a href="/signals/private_credit_impulse.html" target="_blank">5</a>)</li>
  <li>Overall credit environment: <strong>Neutral/Normal with underlying elevated stress signals.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Credit Spreads</h3>
<p>The Credit Spreads Composite (CSC) is currently in a "NORMAL" regime as of December 31, 2025, with a z-score of -0.13 and a composite score of 19.69(<a href="/signals/credit_spreads_composite.html" target="_blank">1</a>). This reflects historically low absolute High Yield (HY_OAS at 2.95%) and Investment Grade (IG_OAS at 0.81%) option-adjusted spreads, as indicated by their negative level z-scores(<a href="/signals/credit_spreads_composite.html" target="_blank">1</a>). However, both HY and IG spreads exhibit positive 3-month and 12-month momentum z-scores (e.g., HY 3m_ann_z at 0.67), signaling recent widening pressure. This upward momentum prevents the signal from entering an "EASY" regime, positioning it in a state of moderate stability following a period of "EASY" conditions in prior months(<a href="/signals/credit_spreads_composite.html" target="_blank">1</a>).</p>

<h3>2. Systemic Financial Stress</h3>
<p>The Financial Stress Composite indicates a "Neutral" regime as of December 31, 2025, with a composite value of -0.217(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_composite.html" target="_blank">3</a>). This composite incorporates the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4), HY_OAS, and the inverted 10Y-2Y Treasury spread. While the STLFSI4's z-score is positive (0.489), contributing to higher stress, this is offset by negative z-scores from HY_OAS (-0.443) and the inverted yield curve (-0.697), both indicating lower stress(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_composite.html" target="_blank">3</a>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the standalone Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) signal is categorized as "Bearish" as of December 12, 2025(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_index.html" target="_blank">4</a>). This classification is driven by a robust z-score of 0.906, which exceeds the +0.5 threshold for elevated stress, despite the STLFSI4 level itself being negative (-0.3606)(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_index.html" target="_blank">4</a>). This divergence suggests that while broader composite measures remain neutral, the primary St. Louis Fed index is signaling a heightened degree of systemic financial tension.</p>

<h3>3. Credit Conditions Composite</h3>
<p>The Credit Conditions signal is classified as "Neutral" with a smoothed index value of -0.289 as of December 31, 2025(<a href="/signals/credit_conditions.html" target="_blank">2</a>). This composite integrates robust-normalized High Yield (HY_OAS), BBB Option-Adjusted Spreads (BBB_OAS), and the CBOE Volatility Index (VIXCLS). The current "Neutral" regime implies a benign funding backdrop, with credit spreads and volatility operating near their typical historical ranges(<a href="/signals/credit_conditions.html" target="_blank">2</a>).</p>
<p>For December 2025, HY_OAS (2.95) and BBB_OAS (1.03) contributed z-scores of -0.378 and -0.450 respectively, indicating a slight easing within their historical context. The VIXCLS (16.87) registered a near-neutral z-score of 0.078. The overall composite raw index of -0.250 smoothed to -0.289, maintaining the "Neutral" classification observed since April 2025, which aligns with the "NORMAL" regime of the Credit Spreads Composite(<a href="/signals/credit_conditions.html" target="_blank">2</a>).</p>

<h3>4. Private Credit Impulse</h3>
<p>The Private Credit Impulse signal indicates a "Stable" credit growth regime, registering a composite value of 0.306 as of December 31, 2025(<a href="/signals/private_credit_impulse.html" target="_blank">5</a>). This signal, which tracks the 6-month annualised growth rates of total bank credit, commercial &amp; industrial loans, and consumer loans, has transitioned to a stable phase following a decelerating period earlier in 2025(<a href="/signals/private_credit_impulse.html" target="_blank">5</a>).</p>
<p>The latest composite value is primarily driven by the robust-standardized growth of total bank credit (Z_TOTBKCR_ann6 at 0.306 for December 2025)(<a href="/signals/private_credit_impulse.html" target="_blank">5</a>). However, the overall interpretation for December 2025 is subject to limitations due to the absence of reported data for commercial &amp; industrial loans and total consumer loans for that specific month(<a href="/signals/private_credit_impulse.html" target="_blank">5</a>).</p>

<h3>5. Synthesised US Credit Conditions Assessment</h3>
<p>Overall US credit conditions present a complex picture, characterized by a prevailing "Neutral" or "Normal" state across several composite indicators, yet concurrently flagged by an underlying "Bearish" signal from a key systemic stress measure. Credit Spreads remain "NORMAL"(<a href="/signals/credit_spreads_composite.html" target="_blank">1</a>), indicating low absolute spread levels but with observed widening momentum, which suggests a shift from an 'easy' to a more normalized but potentially cautious phase. This aligns with the "Neutral" classification of the Credit Conditions Composite(<a href="/signals/credit_conditions.html" target="_blank">2</a>) and the broader Financial Stress Composite(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_composite.html" target="_blank">3</a>), both reflecting stable funding conditions and moderate market risk.</p>
<p>However, the "Bearish" signal from the Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4)(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_index.html" target="_blank">4</a>) due to an elevated z-score introduces a notable tension. This suggests that while average credit and volatility metrics might appear stable, more granular or foundational measures of systemic stress are elevated, indicating pockets of financial fragility or heightened risk aversion that are not fully captured or are being offset within the broader composites. The "Stable" Private Credit Impulse(<a href="/signals/private_credit_impulse.html" target="_blank">5</a>) points to continued, albeit not accelerating, credit creation, providing a supportive but cautious backdrop to the overall credit environment.</p>

<h3>6. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside / Supportive</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Continued or accelerating private credit growth, especially if supported by a resolution of current data incompleteness(<a href="/signals/private_credit_impulse.html" target="_blank">5</a>).</li>
  <li>Contained equity volatility and stable funding conditions across corporate debt markets, as reflected by persistently neutral Credit Conditions Composite readings(<a href="/signals/credit_conditions.html" target="_blank">2</a>).</li>
  <li>Normalization or easing of the Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) from its current bearish level back towards neutral or bullish regimes(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_index.html" target="_blank">4</a>).</li>
  <li>Persistently tight credit spreads (HY and IG OAS) and subdued stress readings in the Financial Stress Composite, reinforcing a low default risk environment(<a href="/signals/credit_spreads_composite.html" target="_blank">1</a>)(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_composite.html" target="_blank">3</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside / Stress</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Further spread widening across both High Yield and Investment Grade markets, driven by continued positive momentum in spread z-scores, potentially leading to a "Tightening" or "STRESSED" regime for the Credit Spreads Composite(<a href="/signals/credit_spreads_composite.html" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li>An increase in the Financial Stress Composite beyond its current neutral state, or a sustained "Bearish" classification for the Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4), signaling heightened systemic tension and risk aversion(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_composite.html" target="_blank">3</a>)(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_index.html" target="_blank">4</a>).</li>
  <li>Renewed deceleration or contraction in private credit growth, or further deterioration in data completeness, indicating tightening credit supply or falling demand, which could precede an economic slowdown(<a href="/signals/private_credit_impulse.html" target="_blank">5</a>).</li>
  <li>An increase in the Credit Conditions Composite z-score above 0.75, moving it into a "Tightening" regime, suggesting higher financing costs and a risk-off sentiment(<a href="/signals/credit_conditions.html" target="_blank">2</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The current credit regime implies a broadly steady risk sentiment environment, with corporate funding conditions generally accessible. While the Credit Spreads Composite remains "NORMAL"(<a href="/signals/credit_spreads_composite.html" target="_blank">1</a>) and the Credit Conditions Composite is "Neutral"(<a href="/signals/credit_conditions.html" target="_blank">2</a>), the observed upward momentum in spreads and the "Bearish" signal from the Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4)(<a href="/signals/financial_stress_index.html" target="_blank">4</a>) suggest that while broad market functioning is stable, there are underlying signals of increasing vigilance regarding financial stability. This environment supports refinancing activity and limits default risk, characteristic of a mid-cycle phase where credit fundamentals remain sound but early warnings of potential stress are emerging.</p>
<p>Such conditions position credit markets within broader macro/financial cycles as generally supportive, yet with a heightened awareness of potential inflection points. The "Stable" Private Credit Impulse(<a href="/signals/private_credit_impulse.html" target="_blank">5</a>) suggests that overall credit expansion continues at a moderate pace, but monitoring for shifts in credit growth momentum will be crucial for discerning future economic trajectory and associated credit risks.</p>

<h3>Missing Content / Critical Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Private Credit Impulse signal for December 2025 has missing data for Commercial &amp; Industrial Loans (BUSLOANS) and Total Consumer Loans Owned by Banks (TOTALSL) 6-month annualised growth rates in the provided table. This incompleteness hinders a full and precise assessment of private credit momentum for the latest period and may impact the composite's accuracy. Resolution requires updated data for these components.</li>
