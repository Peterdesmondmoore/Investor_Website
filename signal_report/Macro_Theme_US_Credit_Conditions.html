  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>US credit conditions present a bifurcated environment. Market-based credit risk, as reflected in corporate bond spreads and broader credit conditions composites, currently indicates a neutral to normal state. High Yield (HY) and Investment Grade (IG) option-adjusted spreads are contained, suggesting a benign perception of corporate funding stress, with recent momentum indicating a subtle upward drift in spreads after a period of tightening.</p>
<p>Conversely, the standalone St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) has registered a 'Bearish' signal as of November 21, 2025, with its z-score indicating elevated systemic stress. This represents a divergence from the 'Neutral' classifications of the more encompassing Financial Stress Composite (which incorporates HY spreads, STLFSI4, and yield curve inversion) and the Credit Conditions Index (which combines spreads and VIX). This divergence suggests a potential for incipient, short-term systemic pressure that has not yet fully translated into market-based credit risk premia or has been offset by other factors within the broader composites.</p>
<p>Private credit conditions indicate a stabilization, with the Private-Credit Impulse transitioning from a 'Decelerating' phase to a 'Stable' regime. This suggests a recovery in the underlying momentum of bank and consumer credit growth, which acts as a moderating factor against market stress rather than actively amplifying it. Overall, the environment is characterised by contained market credit risk, an observable rise in a broad financial stress indicator, and a recovering but not yet accelerating private credit supply.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Aggregate Credit Conditions Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Credit Spreads:</strong> Both High Yield (HY_OAS: 3.00%) and Investment Grade (IG_OAS: 0.82%) option-adjusted spreads are at low levels, maintaining a 'NORMAL' regime as of 2025-11-30.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Stress (Composite & Index):</strong> The Financial Stress Composite is categorised as 'Neutral' (Fin_Stress: 0.045) as of 2025-11-30. However, the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) signals 'Bearish' (Stress_z: 1.700081) as of 2025-11-21.</li>
  <li><strong>Private Credit Impulse:</strong> The Private-Credit Impulse stands at 0.44, indicating a 'Stable' regime as of 2025-11-30, with available data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall credit regime is characterised by contained market-based risk premia, a recent indication of elevated systemic stress from a specific index, and recovering underlying private credit growth.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Credit Spreads & Market-Implied Risk</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Direction and Momentum:</strong> As of 2025-11-30, HY_OAS is 3.00% and IG_OAS is 0.82%, maintaining relatively low absolute levels. Spreads have generally declined since April 2025 (HY_OAS: 3.94%; IG_OAS: 1.09%). The 3-month annualised momentum indicators show a slight upward drift (hy_d3m_ann_z: 0.696, ig_d3m_ann_z: 0.355), suggesting a potential deceleration in the narrowing trend.</li>
  <li><strong>Concentration:</strong> The Credit Spreads Composite (CSC_z: -0.108) remains within the 'NORMAL' regime. There is no indication within the provided data that stress is either broadly distributed or concentrated in specific segments of the corporate bond market.</li>
  <li><strong>Regime Shifts:</strong> The credit spreads regime transitioned from 'TIGHTENING' in April 2025 to 'NORMAL' by May 2025, where it has subsequently stabilised.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Financial Stress Indicators</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Level and Trajectory:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The Financial Stress Composite (Fin_Stress) is 0.045 as of 2025-11-30, classified as 'Neutral'. This composite has largely been range-bound within the 'Neutral' regime since January 2025, oscillating between -0.707 and 0.045.</li>
      <li>The St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) stood at -0.1331 as of 2025-11-21, with its robust z-score (Stress_z) at 1.700081. This indicates a 'Bearish' signal, representing a surge from -0.5071 (Neutral) observed on 2025-11-14.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Implied Conditions:</strong> The 'Neutral' classification of the Financial Stress Composite suggests overall market functioning is stable, without severe funding strain or pervasive systemic risk. The 'Neutral' Credit Conditions Index (incorporating VIX, HY OAS, BBB OAS) supports this assessment regarding volatility pressures. However, the 'Bearish' signal from the STLFSI4 alone indicates elevated systemic risk not fully aggregated or smoothed within the composite indicators, potentially reflecting more acute short-term tensions.</li>
  <li><strong>Differences between Composite and Index:</strong> The Financial Stress Composite incorporates STLFSI4, HY_OAS, and the inverted T10Y2Y. Its 'Neutral' regime classification contrasts with the 'Bearish' signal from the raw STLFSI4 Index. This divergence suggests that the contained HY spreads and positively sloped yield curve (T10Y2Y) within the composite are currently offsetting the elevated stress indicated by the STLFSI4 z-score.</li>
  <li><strong>Signal Convergence/Divergence:</strong> The signals are divergent. While the smoothed composite indicators suggest overall 'Neutral' credit and financial conditions, the dedicated St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index provides a 'Bearish' signal, indicating that systemic stress components are increasing individually.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Private Credit Conditions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Direction and Strength of Flows:</strong> The Private-Credit Impulse is 0.44 as of 2025-11-30, classified as 'Stable'. This composite is derived from growth rates of total bank credit, commercial & industrial loans, and total consumer loans, though November data is partially available (only Total Bank Credit).</li>
  <li><strong>Expansion, Contracting, or Plateauing:</strong> Private credit is stabilising. The impulse has moved upward from a low of -1.04 in January 2025, indicating a recovery from a 'Decelerating' phase. It is currently in a 'Stable' regime, suggesting moderate credit creation rather than rapid expansion or contraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Offsetting or Amplifying Market Stress:</strong> The 'Stable' private credit impulse suggests that underlying credit flows are not currently amplifying market stress. Its recovery from a decelerating phase may act as a moderating factor, providing a stable, albeit not strongly expansive, financing backdrop.</li>
  <li><strong>Cyclical or Regime-Driven:</strong> The behaviour appears cyclical, reflecting a recovery in credit growth momentum from a prior deceleration.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Cross-Signal Synthesis</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement between Signals:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Credit Spreads ('NORMAL'), Credit Conditions ('Neutral'), and the Financial Stress Composite ('Neutral') generally align, indicating a non-stressed, moderate, or benign credit and funding environment.</li>
      <li>The contained levels of HY and IG spreads, coupled with a moderately positive yield curve spread (T10Y2Y: 0.55%), contribute to the 'Neutral' composite readings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conflicts or Asymmetries:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A notable asymmetry exists between the 'Bearish' signal from the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4, as of 2025-11-21) and the 'Neutral' or 'NORMAL' regimes indicated by the broader Credit Conditions and Financial Stress Composite signals (as of 2025-11-30). This suggests that while underlying specific systemic stress components are increasing, their overall impact on credit markets or other financial conditions has either been offset or is yet to be fully reflected in the smoothed composites.</li>
      <li>The 'Stable' Private Credit Impulse indicates a recovery in credit growth, but it is not strong enough to push overall credit conditions into an 'Easing' regime, nor is it decelerating to imply 'Tightening'. This moderate pace of private credit acts as a neutral influence on overall credit dynamics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Short-Cycle from Structural Signals:</strong> The 'Bearish' signal from the STLFSI4 appears to be a short-cycle perturbation, given its recent sharp increase and divergence from other broader indicators. The 'NORMAL' credit spread regime and 'Stable' private credit impulse suggest that the structural underpinnings of credit availability and pricing remain contained.</li>
  <li><strong>Configuration Implies:</strong> The current configuration implies neutral credit conditions, with an observable and recent increase in short-term systemic stress signals that warrant monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Watchpoints (Forward-Looking Conditions)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Escalate Systemic Stress:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Credit Spreads Composite (CSC_z) crossing +0.5, or HY_OAS rising above 5.0%.</li>
      <li>Financial Stress Composite (Fin_Stress) exceeding +0.75.</li>
      <li>Credit Conditions (Credit_Conditions) crossing +0.75.</li>
      <li>St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) remaining 'Bearish' for two consecutive weekly readings, or its Stress_z component exceeding 2.0.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Signal Normalisation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) returning to a 'Neutral' or 'Bullish' classification.</li>
      <li>Credit Spreads 3-month annualised z-scores (hy_d3m_ann_z, ig_d3m_ann_z) consistently reverting below 0.0.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mark a Regime Change in Credit Conditions:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Private Credit Impulse transitioning into an 'Accelerating' regime (Private_Credit_Impulse > 0.75).</li>
      <li>A sustained transition of the Credit Conditions index into an 'Easing' regime (Credit_Conditions < -0.75).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Credit availability appears stable, with the Private-Credit Impulse showing a cyclical recovery from a decelerating phase to a 'Stable' regime. Market-based risk pricing dynamics indicate contained corporate credit risk, with spreads in a 'NORMAL' regime. However, there is a distinct signal of elevated short-term systemic stress from the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index, which currently diverges from the 'Neutral' readings of broader, more composite financial conditions indicators. This configuration suggests a resilient but not entirely unpressured credit environment, where structural features remain sound but cyclical stress signals have become apparent.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Model & Signal Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Missing Dimensions of Credit Risk or Financing Supply:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Integration of money market liquidity measures and cross-currency basis swaps to capture interbank funding dynamics.</li>
      <li>Inclusion of forward-looking private credit sentiment indicators, such as senior loan officer surveys.</li>
      <li>Explicit incorporation of equity market implied volatility (VIX) directly into the Credit Spreads Composite for a more comprehensive market-implied risk view.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Areas for Further Model Refinement:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Harmonisation of reporting frequencies across all financial stress indicators to improve temporal alignment and reduce lead/lag issues.</li>
      <li>Development of dynamic weighting schemes for composite indicators that adapt sensitivity during periods of pronounced market volatility or regime shifts.</li>
      <li>Calibration of regime thresholds using a wider array of historical stress events to enhance the robustness and predictive power of classification.</li>
    </ul>
