  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>US monetary conditions exhibit a nuanced easing bias, primarily driven by significant liquidity injections from the unwinding of the Federal Reserve's Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement (ON RRP) facility. The Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite transitioned into an "Expansion" regime in July 2025 and currently registers 1.30 as of November 30, 2025. This expansion occurs despite ongoing quantitative tightening, as evidenced by contracting Federal Reserve total assets and reserve balances.</p>
<p>Liquidity support is strong and persistent, with the inverted ON RRP usage registering a "Bullish" signal with a -96.17% year-over-year decline. Money supply (M2) dynamics have recently moderated, with the M2 signal shifting to "Neutral" as of November 30, 2025, after a period of "Bullish" expansion. Concurrently, the US 10-year real interest rate has moved from a "Bearish" (restrictive) to a "Neutral" regime, with the latest reading at 1.77% as of November 1, 2025, closely aligning with its 6-month trend.</p>
<p>The interaction between these signals indicates an overall environment of diminishing monetary restrictiveness. The substantial liquidity provided by the ON RRP unwinding is effectively counteracting other tightening measures, fostering an expansionary liquidity environment that is broadly consistent with a stabilization in real interest rates from previously elevated, restrictive levels.</p>

<h2>Aggregate Liquidity & Monetary State</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite:</strong> The composite is in an "Expansion" regime, with a value of 1.30 as of November 30, 2025. This indicates a net expansion of Fed-related liquidity.</li>
  <li><strong>Money Supply (M2) Dynamics:</strong> The M2 signal is "Neutral" as of November 30, 2025, moderating from a previous "Bullish" stance observed through October 2025.</li>
  <li><strong>Real Interest Rate Trend:</strong> The US 10-year real yield is in a "Neutral" regime, recorded at 1.77% as of November 1, 2025, positioned within its 6-month moving average.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall monetary conditions exhibit a discernible easing bias, predominantly driven by liquidity expansion, while broad money growth has moderated and real rates have stabilized from a restrictive posture.</p>

<h2>Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite</h2>
<p>Federal Reserve-related liquidity is currently in an expanding state, having transitioned from a "Neutral" to an "Expansion" regime in July 2025. The latest composite value stands at 1.30 as of November 30, 2025, indicating sustained expansion.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Regime Shift:</strong> The shift to "Expansion" in July 2025 marks a significant inflection point, with the composite consistently above the 0.75 threshold. This is considered a regime-level change.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Drivers:</strong> The primary driver of this expansion is the significant decline in ON RRP usage, which has consistently registered a "Bullish" signal. As of November 30, 2025, the inverted RRP Year-over-Year change is -96.17%, and the 3-month change is -90.29%, reflecting a substantial withdrawal from the facility.</li>
  <li><strong>Counteracting Factors:</strong> This liquidity injection is occurring concurrently with "Bearish" signals from Federal Reserve Total Assets (YoY -5.11%) and Reserve Balances (YoY -10.26%) as of November 30, 2025, indicating ongoing quantitative tightening. The strength of the ON RRP decline is currently overriding these contractionary forces.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Money Supply (M2) Dynamics</h2>
<p>The M2 money supply signal has recently transitioned from an expansionary phase to a neutral stance. As of November 30, 2025, the M2 signal is "Neutral," a moderation from the "Bullish" signal observed in October 2025, where year-over-year growth was 4.65% and the 3-month change was 1.22%.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Direction and Momentum:</strong> M2 experienced robust "Bullish" momentum from June 2025 through October 2025, following a prolonged "Bearish" phase from 2023 through early 2024. The most recent observation indicates a shift to "Neutral" momentum.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear Transitions:</strong> The transition from "Bearish" to "Bullish" in mid-2025 was a notable shift. The subsequent moderation to "Neutral" in November 2025 indicates a pause in the acceleration of broad money growth.</li>
  <li><strong>Relationship to Liquidity:</strong> The recent "Neutral" M2 signal suggests that broad money expansion is less dynamic compared to the pronounced "Expansion" signal from the Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite, which is primarily influenced by the structural unwinding of the ON RRP facility.</li>
  <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> The M2 signal's transition to "Neutral" for November 2025 suggests that the previously "Bullish" momentum may not be persistent in the short term, requiring further monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real Interest Rate Trend</h2>
<p>The US 10-year real interest rate trend indicates a stabilization from previously restrictive levels.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Level and Direction:</strong> The US 10-year real yield (DFII10) is currently 1.77% as of November 1, 2025. It has moved from being above its 6-month trend to within a neutral band. The 6-month moving average of DFII10 is 1.885% for the same period.</li>
  <li><strong>Restrictiveness:</strong> The signal transitioned to "Neutral" as of November 1, 2025, from a period of persistent "Bearish" signals from late 2024 through early 2025, where real yields were consistently above their trend. This indicates that real rates are becoming less restrictive compared to the preceding period.</li>
  <li><strong>Alignment or Tension:</strong> The easing in the real interest rate trend, moving to "Neutral," aligns directionally with the "Expansion" in the Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite. This suggests a broad, albeit nuanced, easing of financial conditions across both real-rate and liquidity dimensions, reducing tension that existed when real rates were rising alongside some liquidity expansion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cross-Signal Synthesis</h2>
<p>The current cross-asset signals present a complex but generally directionally aligned narrative of easing monetary conditions.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The significant "Expansion" regime in the Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite, driven by the unwinding of ON RRP, aligns with the US 10-year real yield moving from a "Bearish" to a "Neutral" regime. This indicates a broad reduction in monetary restrictiveness from both liquidity supply and real funding cost perspectives.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conflicts:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The "Bearish" signals from Federal Reserve Total Assets and Reserve Balances, indicative of ongoing quantitative tightening, present a structural counterpoint to the powerful liquidity impulse from ON RRP unwinding.</li>
      <li>The M2 money supply signal's recent shift to "Neutral" in November 2025 introduces a degree of divergence from the pronounced "Expansion" observed in the broader Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite, suggesting that while specific Fed-related liquidity channels are expanding significantly, broad money growth may be decelerating.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Short-horizon vs Medium-horizon Indications:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Short-horizon:</strong> The rapid unwinding of the ON RRP facility provides an immediate and strong liquidity injection.</li>
      <li><strong>Medium-horizon:</strong> The sustained "Expansion" regime in the Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite since July 2025 and the shift in real yields to "Neutral" indicate a multi-month trend of less restrictive financial conditions. The moderation of M2 to "Neutral" is a more recent development that warrants attention over the medium term for potential implications for broader economic activity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the signals, the overall configuration appears to be <strong>supportive</strong> for the real economy, with systemic liquidity expanding and real interest rates stabilizing from their restrictive trend.</p>

<h2>Watchpoints (Forward-Looking Conditions)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A sustained increase in Federal Reserve Total Assets or Reserve Balances (YoY values moving towards positive growth) would indicate a potential reversal or moderation of current liquidity expansion.</li>
  <li>A reversal of the decline in ON RRP usage (YoY change for inverted RRP moving from highly negative towards zero or positive) would signal a significant reduction in a primary source of current liquidity injection.</li>
  <li>A return of the M2 signal to a "Bullish" regime (M2 YoY greater than 6.0% or 3M change greater than 1.0%) would confirm re-acceleration in broad money supply.</li>
  <li>A shift of the M2 signal to a "Bearish" regime (M2 YoY below 2.0% or 3M change below -1.0%) would indicate renewed broad monetary contraction.</li>
  <li>The US 10-year real yield (DFII10) consistently moving above its 6-month trend by more than 0.05% would mark a return to a "Bearish," more restrictive real rate environment.</li>
  <li>A transition of the Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite back to a "Neutral" (composite between -0.75 and 0.75) or "Contraction" (composite below -0.75) regime would signal a fundamental shift in systemic liquidity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The current monetary and liquidity regime is characterized by an ongoing shift towards greater accommodation. This is predominantly driven by structural liquidity unwinding from the ON RRP facility, which is robustly counteracting the continued, albeit decelerating, quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve. Real interest rates have transitioned from a restrictive "Bearish" posture to a "Neutral" stance, aligning with this overall easing trend.</p>
<p>The balance between structural and cyclical drivers indicates that the structural decline in ON RRP is a powerful and persistent force for liquidity expansion. However, the cyclical moderation in M2 growth suggests a nuanced picture for broader monetary dynamics. Conditions appear to be transitioning from a period of high restrictiveness to a more stable, accommodating environment, though the underlying quantitative tightening and the recent M2 deceleration introduce potential for inflection if the primary liquidity drivers change course.</p>

<h2>Model & Signal Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Missing Indicators:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Inclusion of market-based inflation expectations, such as 10-year Treasury breakeven inflation rates, to provide a more complete picture of real rate dynamics and their components.</li>
      <li>Integration of credit spread data (e.g., BAA-AAA corporate bond spread, TED spread) to gauge risk appetite and financial market stress beyond central bank balance sheet actions.</li>
      <li>Incorporation of FX liquidity measures, such as cross-currency basis swaps or central bank swap line usage, for a global liquidity perspective.</li>
      <li>Addition of market implied volatility indices (e.g., VIX) as a real-time gauge of risk perception and hedging demand.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Possible Refinements:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic calibration of signal thresholds based on rolling historical distributions or varying market conditions, rather than fixed values, to enhance regime adaptability.</li>
      <li>Exploration of alternative weighting schemes for the Federal Reserve Liquidity Composite inputs, potentially using factor analysis or historical correlation to economic outcomes, instead of equal weighting.</li>
      <li>Investigation of alternative smoothing or trend-following methods for real yields beyond the 6-month simple moving average, such as exponential moving averages or adaptive filters.</li>
    </ul>
