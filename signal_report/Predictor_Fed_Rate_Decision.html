<p><em>Probabilistic assessment of the next FOMC policy decision based on the current macro regime, financial conditions, and Fed communications.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The current macro regime is best characterized as a data-dependent, decelerating late-cycle environment with persistent disinflationary pressures and emerging credit fragility, against a backdrop of easing liquidity. While recent FOMC decisions have already implemented two consecutive rate cuts in response to softening labor market and inflation dynamics, the Committee faces significant uncertainty due to a data drought stemming from a government shutdown and strongly differing views among participants regarding the immediate path forward. As such, a prudent pause to assess incoming information and the impact of previous policy adjustments is the most probable outcome for the next FOMC meeting.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inflation &amp; prices:</strong> Overall "COOL" regime with PCE below 3% YoY and stable/cooling market expectations, suggesting sustained disinflation.</li>
  <li><strong>Labour market:</strong> "Neutral with Emerging Slack and Demand Headwinds," characterized by gradually softening conditions, rising underemployment, and bearish turnover, despite some resilience in initial claims.</li>
  <li><strong>Growth &amp; demand:</strong> "Decelerating Late-Cycle with Emerging Credit Fragility," showing mixed real activity, softening consumer spending, but some resilience in core manufacturing and AI-driven investment.</li>
  <li><strong>Liquidity &amp; financial conditions:</strong> "Expansionary" due to ON RRP unwind and re-accelerating M2, with real interest rates stabilizing in a "Neutral" posture.</li>
  <li><strong>Credit &amp; risk:</strong> "Broadly Neutral" but with emerging upward pressure on spreads, underlying stress in the STLFSI4, and rising consumer loan delinquencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Global &amp; USD backdrop:</strong> Weakening USD easing global financial conditions, alongside resilient industrial demand but defensive precious metals positioning.</li>
  <li><strong>Market pricing &amp; positioning:</strong> Calm equity volatility, but concentrated risks in commodities ("Supply Stress" active theme) and specific index divergences. Market expectations for further cuts exist but are nuanced.</li>
  <li><strong>Fed communication tone:</strong> Recent cuts (Sept, Oct) reflecting a shift in balance of risks; explicit caution from Chair Powell about December not being a "foregone conclusion" and acknowledging "strongly differing views" and a "data drought."</li>

<h3>Channel-by-Channel Policy Assessment</h3>

<p>This section decomposes the policy decision into key macro-financial channels, indicating whether each channel is currently exerting pressure towards a CUT, HOLD, or HIKE decision.</p>

<h3>Inflation &amp; Price Dynamics</h3>
<p>The overall inflation signal is "COOL," with both PCE and Core PCE tracking below 3% YoY in September 2025, and market-implied expectations appearing stable with recent cooling momentum. While tariff-induced goods inflation remains an upside risk, it is largely viewed as a one-time price level shift. This channel generally pushes towards a <strong>CUT</strong>, supporting further easing.</p>

<h3>Labour Market</h3>
<p>The labor market is assessed as "Neutral with Emerging Slack and Demand Headwinds," evidenced by a rising unemployment rate (4.4% in Sep 2025), increasing U-6 underutilization, easing JOLTS tightness, and bearish turnover signals. While initial claims show some resilience, the overall trend indicates gradual cooling. This channel strongly pushes towards a <strong>CUT</strong>, reflecting increased downside risks to employment.</p>

<h3>Growth &amp; Business Cycle</h3>
<p>The growth and business cycle regime is "Decelerating Late-Cycle with Emerging Credit Fragility." National economic activity is largely unchanged to slightly softer, with declining consumer spending (ex-high-end) and mixed real activity. The Beige Book highlighted ongoing uncertainty and risks of slower activity, exacerbated by a government shutdown. This channel leans towards a <strong>CUT</strong>, signaling a need for accommodative policy, though some areas of resilience argue for caution.</p>

<h3>Liquidity &amp; Monetary Conditions</h3>
<p>Liquidity conditions are "Expansionary," primarily driven by the significant unwind in the ON RRP facility and re-accelerating M2 money supply. Real interest rates have stabilized to a "Neutral" regime after an extended restrictive period. This channel is broadly supportive and exerts pressure towards a <strong>CUT</strong> or at least reinforces the current easing bias by alleviating money market stress.</p>

<h3>Credit Conditions &amp; Risk Transmission</h3>
<p>Credit conditions are "Broadly Neutral with emerging upward pressure on spreads and some underlying stress indicators." While overall credit spreads remain tight, recent momentum indicates widening, and the STLFSI4 signal is "Bearish," suggesting elevated stress in this component. Rising consumer loan delinquencies and tightening bank lending standards, as reported in the Beige Book, are a concern. This channel points towards a <strong>CUT</strong> to alleviate financial strain and mitigate credit risks.</p>

<h3>Global Backdrop &amp; USD</h3>
<p>The USD is in a "Weakening" regime, which generally eases global financial conditions and has a disinflationary impact. While industrial demand shows resilience, speculative positioning in precious metals is defensive, indicating broader caution. This channel generally supports a <strong>CUT</strong> or a neutral stance, as global factors are not currently demanding a hawkish response.</p>

<h3>Cross-Asset Positioning &amp; Market Pricing</h3>
<p>Equity market volatility (VIX) is "CALM," but futures positioning reveals concentrated risks, including an active "Supply Stress" macro theme in commodities and significant speculative-hedger divergence in Nasdaq 100 futures. Market pricing has previously implied further cuts, though recent Fed communication has pushed back on a "foregone conclusion" for the next meeting. This channel presents a mixed signal, with calm equity sentiment but underlying commodity market tensions, suggesting a potential for <strong>HOLD</strong> to manage expectations and assess real impacts.</p>

<h3>Fed Communications &amp; Reaction Function</h3>
<p>The FOMC has recently executed two 25bp cuts (September and October 2025), moving the federal funds rate target to 3.75-4%. Chair Powell explicitly stated that a December cut is "not a foregone conclusion," citing "strongly differing views" among participants and a "data drought" due to the government shutdown, which could warrant caution. The decision to conclude balance sheet runoff on December 1 is a dovish signal, proactively easing financial conditions. This channel strongly pushes towards a <strong>HOLD</strong>, emphasizing data dependence, internal consensus-building, and risk management in an uncertain environment.</p>

<h3>Qualitative Scenario Path (Next 1–2 Meetings)</h3>

<p>The current regime suggests the Committee will likely maintain the federal funds rate at its current level in the upcoming meeting, following two recent cuts and the cessation of quantitative tightening, which collectively mark a significant policy adjustment. This pause would allow the Committee to carefully assess the impact of these actions, monitor the highly uncertain economic data flow (exacerbated by the government shutdown), and build consensus amidst divergent internal views. Over the subsequent 1-2 meetings, the policy path will be highly contingent on whether the disinflationary trend solidifies further, if labor market slack unambiguously increases, or if economic activity shows more pronounced weakness or resilience.</p>

    </tr>

<h3>Data Gaps &amp; Missing Inputs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Missing or not-yet-released US Labour Market payrolls data for October and November 2025 significantly limits confidence in a granular assessment of current labor market momentum.</li>
  <li>Absence of December 2025 STLFSI4 data limits the real-time assessment of systemic financial stress for the latest period.</li>
  <li>Lack of the full range of government-provided economic data for October and November 2025 (e.g., CPI, PPI for Nov, detailed spending reports) due to the government shutdown, necessitating reliance on private sector and anecdotal information.</li>
  <li>Missing specific G10 FX CoT data for GBP limits a comprehensive view of global FX positioning and vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Balance of Risks &amp; Confidence</h3>

<strong>Risks Around the Baseline Decision</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Key conditions that would push the Committee toward an earlier or larger CUT: A rapid, unmistakable deterioration in the labor market (e.g., sharp rise in layoffs or unemployment claims beyond current cooling trend), a clear and sustained decline in core PCE inflation well below 2.5%, or an unexpected and severe tightening of credit conditions leading to systemic financial stress.</li>
  <li>Key conditions that would push toward an extended HOLD despite softening data: Persisting data gaps making it difficult to ascertain underlying trends, continued internal disagreement on policy direction, or a perception that previous policy actions (two cuts, end of QT) require more time to transmit fully through the economy.</li>
  <li>Key conditions that could re-open the possibility of a HIKE (even if low probability): A material re-acceleration of core inflation (e.g., above 3.0% YoY excluding tariff effects) that threatens to unanchor inflation expectations, a robust and broad-based re-tightening of the labor market with accelerating wage growth, or an unexpected surge in demand-side economic activity.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Assessment of Confidence</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Confidence in the baseline probability split (HOLD 70%, CUT 25%, HIKE 5%) is medium.</li>
  <li>Main sources of uncertainty include the ongoing data drought from the government shutdown, which obscures a comprehensive real-time view of economic activity, and the explicitly acknowledged "strongly differing views" within the FOMC on the appropriate future policy path, indicating internal consensus is not firmly established for further immediate easing.</li>
