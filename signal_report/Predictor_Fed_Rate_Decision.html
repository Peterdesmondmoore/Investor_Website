<p><em>Probabilistic assessment of the next FOMC policy decision based on the current macro regime, financial conditions, and Fed communications.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The macro regime is characterized by late-cycle deceleration with underlying disinflationary trends and increasing labor market slack, despite some resilient growth pockets. The Federal Reserve has recently implemented two successive rate cuts and announced the cessation of Quantitative Tightening. Against this backdrop, the Committee's outlook is data-dependent with acknowledged internal disagreements, suggesting a strong likelihood of a pause to assess cumulative policy impacts. The headline probability split for the next FOMC decision is heavily weighted towards HOLD, with a lower probability for CUT and a minimal chance of a HIKE. The dominant channels driving this decision are the evolving labor market, persistent yet moderating inflation, and the need to evaluate the impact of recent monetary policy adjustments.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Inflation &amp; prices:</strong> Overall disinflationary trend (COOL composite), but PCE inflation remains elevated within a Neutral band, with market expectations STABLE. Tariffs continue to exert upward pressure on goods prices.</li>
  <li><strong>Labour market:</strong> Cooling at the margin with increasing hidden slack (NEUTRAL composite, nearing COOL). Unemployment rising, turnover bearish, and payroll momentum softening.</li>
  <li><strong>Growth &amp; demand:</strong> Late-cycle deceleration with emerging headwinds. Consumer spending softening, but core manufacturing and AI investment show resilience. Beige Book notes overall activity largely unchanged with slight deterioration.</li>
  <li><strong>Liquidity &amp; financial conditions:</strong> Expansionary due to ON RRP unwind, offsetting balance sheet contraction (which ends December 1). M2 shows accelerating impulse (lagged data), real rates are Neutral.</li>
  <li><strong>Credit &amp; risk:</strong> Neutral overall, but STLFSI4 signals Bearish (elevated systemic stress), and consumer delinquencies are rising. Lending standards are tightening.</li>
  <li><strong>Global &amp; USD backdrop:</strong> USD is Weakening (disinflationary global impulse), but FX positioning shows high tension. Global growth is mixed with resilient cyclical demand balanced by defensive overlays.</li>
  <li><strong>Market pricing &amp; positioning:</strong> Market implied inflation expectations are Stable. Equity markets strong (tech/AI optimism). VIX is Normal. CoT data shows crowding in some commodity sectors.</li>
  <li><strong>Fed communication tone:</strong> Committee has cut rates twice and ended QT. Chair Powell explicitly stated that a further cut in December is "not a foregone conclusion" and noted "strongly differing views" among members. Emphasizes data dependency and balancing dual mandate risks.</li>

<h3>Channel-by-Channel Policy Assessment</h3>

<p>This section decomposes the policy decision into key channels, evaluating whether each channel is pushing toward a CUT, HOLD, or HIKE for the next FOMC meeting.</p>

<h3>Inflation &amp; Price Dynamics</h3>
<p>The overall US inflation composite is COOL, indicating disinflationary pressures. While PCE and Core PCE (2.8% in September) are in a Neutral, albeit disinflationary, regime (below their rolling medians), they remain elevated relative to the 2% target. Market-implied inflation expectations are Stable, suggesting anchoring, but the CPI-PPI divergence (PPI > CPI) points to some upstream cost-push pressures, partly attributed to tariffs, which the Fed views as a temporary price-level effect. This mixed picture for inflation generally supports a HOLD to assess the path of disinflation, with a dovish tilt if disinflationary forces accelerate.</p>

<h3>Labour Market</h3>
<p>The US labor market is Cooling at the Margin with Increasing Hidden Slack. Employment composition is Neutral, but nearing the "COOL" threshold due to rising unemployment (4.3% in August) and persistent slack. Labor market tightness (JOLTS) is Neutral, but turnover is Bearish, reflecting declining worker confidence. Wage growth is Neutral but easing. The Fed has acknowledged rising downside risks to employment, which broadly supports a CUT, though current data points to a gradual cooling rather than a sharp deterioration, hence leaning more towards a HOLD in the immediate term to observe further developments.</p>

<h3>Growth &amp; Business Cycle</h3>
<p>The US business cycle is in a Late-Cycle Deceleration with Emerging Headwinds. Consumer spending, particularly for lower- and middle-income households, is softening. Capex intent is Neutral and volatile, but core manufacturing demand remains Bullish, boosted by AI investment. Industrial production is Neutral with moderate growth. The Beige Book reports largely unchanged activity with a slight deterioration in growth distribution. The yield curve signals are mixed, with a Bearish (steepening) GS10-FEDFUNDS but a Flat/Neutral composite slope. Overall, growth signals suggest a HOLD, with potential for a CUT if growth risks materialize more clearly.</p>

<h3>Liquidity &amp; Monetary Conditions</h3>
<p>US liquidity is currently Expansionary, primarily driven by the significant unwind of the Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement (ON RRP) facility, despite ongoing balance sheet contraction. The Fed explicitly decided to conclude Quantitative Tightening (QT) on December 1, a substantial easing of monetary conditions. M2 money supply, though lagged in the composite, shows an accelerating impulse. Real interest rates are in a Neutral regime, suggesting a balanced monetary stance. The recent policy action of ending QT and the expansionary liquidity signal strongly support a HOLD, allowing time for these changes to filter through the financial system.</p>

<h3>Credit Conditions &amp; Risk Transmission</h3>
<p>The US credit environment is overall Neutral, with High Yield and Investment Grade credit spreads remaining Normal (tight). However, there is a divergence in financial stress signals, with the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI4) indicating a Bearish (elevated stress) regime, while the Financial Stress Composite is Neutral. Private credit impulse is Stable, recovering from earlier deceleration. The Beige Book notes tightening credit standards and rising consumer delinquencies. These mixed signals for credit, with pockets of elevated stress, suggest a cautious approach, pushing towards a HOLD, or a CUT if stress intensifies.</p>

<h3>Global Backdrop &amp; USD</h3>
<p>The Broad U.S. Dollar Index is in a Weakening regime, implying a disinflationary impulse globally. However, USD futures positioning exhibits high tension (extreme speculative short vs. hedger long). Global growth presents a mixed picture: strong industrial metals demand (Demand_Tailwind) suggests cyclical resilience, but speculative unwinding in gold and deteriorating Rates sector flow momentum signal emerging defensive sentiment. The Fed acknowledges slower foreign growth and some foreign central banks cutting rates. The overall global backdrop is complex, but the weakening USD and mixed growth signals lean towards a HOLD or even a CUT, reducing external tightening pressures.</p>

<h3>Cross-Asset Positioning &amp; Market Pricing</h3>
<p>Cross-asset sentiment is generally Normal, with VIX volatility in a Normal regime, indicating stabilized market sentiment. Market implied inflation expectations are Stable. Equity markets are buoyant (AI optimism). However, CoT data reveals segmented crowding: speculative long in Metals, short in Ags, and speculative long in Energy with deep hedger shorting. Macro divergence and squeeze/exhaustion risks are Normal. The active "Supply Stress" theme in agriculture highlights localized fundamental pressures. Overall, market pricing for inflation is anchored, and systemic risk appears normal, supporting a HOLD, but specific crowded positions warrant monitoring.</p>

<h3>Fed Communications &amp; Reaction Function</h3>
<p>The FOMC has lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in both September and October, explicitly citing a "shift in the balance of risks" from inflation to employment. Critically, the Committee decided to conclude the reduction of its securities holdings (QT) on December 1, recognizing that reserve balances are approaching ample levels. Chair Powell has stated that a further rate reduction in December is "not a foregone conclusion" and that "strongly differing views" exist among Committee members regarding the future path of policy. The Committee remains data-dependent, assessing incoming information, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks, including challenges from government shutdown-related data gaps and the implications of AI on the labor market. The recent actions and explicit forward guidance strongly suggest a preference for a HOLD at the upcoming meeting to observe policy effects and incoming data.</p>

<h3>Qualitative Scenario Path (Next 1–2 Meetings)</h3>

<p>Given the recent consecutive rate cuts and the cessation of quantitative tightening, the Committee is likely to enter a period of observation over the next 1-2 meetings. The immediate focus will be on assessing the cumulative impact of these significant policy adjustments on inflation, employment, and financial conditions. While the September SEP suggested further easing, Chair Powell's subsequent remarks indicated no preset course and highlighted internal divisions regarding future rate actions. The forthcoming economic data, particularly labor market and inflation reports, will be crucial in shaping the Committee's consensus and dictating any subsequent policy shifts. The uncertainty from data gaps due to the government shutdown also encourages a cautious stance.</p>

<h3>Data Gaps &amp; Missing Inputs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Official September employment data (Employment Situation report) was delayed due to the government shutdown, limiting confidence in recent labor market trends.</li>
  <li>M2 money supply data within the Fed Liquidity Composite for November and December 2025 is unobservable, affecting the real-time assessment of broader monetary conditions.</li>
  <li>SOFR positioning data for the US Liquidity &amp; Monetary Conditions theme is not provided, hindering a complete view of front-end and medium-term policy expectations.</li>
  <li>The "Metals Tailwind" signal in the Global Growth &amp; Economic Cycles theme is only available up to June 30, 2025, limiting its timeliness for the current assessment.</li>
  <li>The provided GBP CoT futures data is a duplicate of JPY futures data, preventing an independent assessment of British Pound positioning and its implications.</li>
  <li>The "Bullish" label for the Broad U.S. Dollar Index (DTWEXBGS) in the Global Inflation &amp; FX Dynamics theme contradicts the methodology's rule and the summary's "Weakening" interpretation, indicating a potential data or labelling inconsistency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Balance of Risks &amp; Confidence</h3>

<strong>Risks Around the Baseline Decision</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Key conditions that would push the Committee toward an earlier or larger CUT than implied by the baseline: A sharper-than-expected rise in the unemployment rate, broader and faster deceleration in core inflation, or a significant deterioration in credit conditions and financial stability metrics (e.g., STLFSI4 worsening materially).</li>
  <li>Key conditions that would push toward an extended HOLD despite softening data: Persistently sticky elevated inflation readings (excluding tariff effects), unexpected resilience in consumer spending, or a clearer tightening in global financial conditions.</li>
  <li>Key conditions that could re-open the possibility of a HIKE (even if low probability): A pronounced re-acceleration of overall inflation, especially core services, coupled with a surprising re-tightening of the labor market or a significant upward shift in long-term inflation expectations.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Assessment of Confidence</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Confidence in the baseline probability split (HOLD) is medium.</li>
  <li>Main sources of uncertainty stem from conflicting signals across channels (e.g., cooling labor market vs. elevated inflation, neutral credit vs. elevated financial stress, resilient manufacturing vs. softening consumer demand) and the acknowledged data gaps due to the government shutdown, which limit the ability to fully assess the most recent economic dynamics. Chair Powell's explicit statement about "strongly differing views" further highlights internal uncertainty regarding the near-term policy path.</li>
