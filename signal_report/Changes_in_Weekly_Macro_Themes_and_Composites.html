<p><em>Comparing last week’s macro-theme and composite assessments with the latest updates.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The US macro environment shows a nuanced shift, acknowledging underlying resilience within a decelerating momentum phase, while explicitly highlighting emerging fragilities in consumer credit. Globally, systemic conditions appear to be normalizing from a more pronounced "risk-off" stance, yet specific G10 FX vulnerabilities and persistent commodity supply stress continue to present targeted risks. The Federal Reserve's cautious easing bias remains consistent with these evolving macro signals.</p>
<p>The overall global macro balance has shifted towards a more nuanced state of rebalancing from explicit risk-off, with some areas of systemic improvement alongside persistent, targeted fragilities. The US composite narrative is now more explicit about both resilience and emerging downside risks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>US Macro Overview regime was refined to emphasize "Resilient Late-Cycle" alongside "Decelerating Momentum and Emerging Downside Risks."</li>
  <li>Global Macro Overview indicates a move away from explicit "Risk-Off" sentiment towards "Rebalancing" in trade and demand, yet persistent supply stress.</li>
  <li>US Credit Conditions were notably downgraded to reflect "Emerging Fragility in consumer credit," a shift from a "Stable and Benign" assessment.</li>
  <li>Cross-Asset Positioning and Sentiment improved systemically, with VIX normalizing to "CALM" and overall divergence risk easing from "High" to "Moderate."</li>
  <li>Global Inflation &amp; FX Dynamics saw a reinterpretation of USD weakness, now linked to a global "disinflationary bias" rather than an "inflationary bias."</li>
  <li>US Growth &amp; Business Cycle shows Capex intent recovering from "Contraction" to "Neutral," though broader growth risks persist.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. US Macro Themes: Weekly Change</h3>
<p>Across US macro themes this week, a subtle shift towards acknowledging underlying resilience, particularly in manufacturing, is noted alongside a more explicit recognition of emerging downside risks. Credit conditions show the most notable deterioration, with new fragilities identified in consumer credit. Labour market conditions remain consistently soft, while liquidity continues to be easing and inflation maintains its disinflationary bias.</p>

<h3>2. Global Macro Themes: Weekly Change</h3>
<p>Globally, market positioning and sentiment indicate a systemic improvement, moving away from an overt risk-off stance, though targeted fragilities persist. The interpretation of US Dollar dynamics and its global inflation impact has been refined. Growth themes now more explicitly bifurcate resilient industrial demand from broader decelerating momentum.</p>

<h3>3. Composite Macro Overviews: Weekly Change</h3>
<p>Both US and Global composite overviews reflect a more nuanced interpretation this week. The US composite now explicitly balances resilience with emerging downside risks, while the global composite moves away from a generalized "risk-off" stance to acknowledge rebalancing and selective fragilities, emphasizing normalizing systemic volatility.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Composite</th>
      <th>Previous Regime</th>
      <th>Current Regime</th>
      <th>Direction of Change</th>
      <th>Key Weekly Change</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>US Macro Overview</td>
      <td>Late-Cycle Deceleration with Easing Liquidity</td>
      <td>Resilient Late-Cycle with Decelerating Momentum and Emerging Downside Risks</td>
      <td>More Nuanced / Downside Risks Acknowledged</td>
      <td>Overall narrative shifted to acknowledge resilience in the late-cycle, while explicitly flagging emerging downside risks from growth and credit fragilities.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Global Macro Overview</td>
      <td>Late-Cycle Resilient with Divergent Pressures</td>
      <td>Resilient Industrial Demand with Decelerating Broader Macro Momentum</td>
      <td>More Specific / Less Overtly Risk-Off</td>
      <td>Global narrative transitioned from "generalized risk-off sentiment" to "decelerating broader economic momentum and selective G10 FX fragilities," with normalizing systemic volatility.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<hr>

<h3>4. Cross-Theme Interpretation</h3>
<p>The weekly changes indicate a macro narrative that, while still characterized by decelerating momentum, is tempered by an emerging recognition of resilience and normalizing systemic financial conditions. The US economy is now explicitly viewed as "Resilient" in its late-cycle phase, yet with clearer articulation of "Emerging Downside Risks," notably from consumer credit fragility. This suggests a less uniform slowdown and more selective vulnerabilities. Concurrently, global risk appetite shows signs of de-stressing, with volatility normalizing and broad positioning divergence easing. However, this systemic improvement coexists with persistent, targeted risks such as commodity "Supply Stress" and specific G10 FX fragilities, along with a revised understanding that USD weakness now imparts a global "disinflationary bias."</p>
<p>A notable divergence is present between improving systemic risk indicators (VIX, overall divergence) and the emergence of specific fundamental fragilities (consumer credit) and persistent supply-side macro themes. This creates a complex environment where broad market sentiment might be more supportive, but underlying economic and positioning-driven vulnerabilities require granular monitoring, particularly with the Fed's ongoing cautious easing bias.</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Forward Risks &amp; Watchpoints</h3>

<h4>Key Upside / Resilience Factors</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Normalization of systemic volatility (VIX CALM) and easing of broad divergence/squeeze risks in cross-asset positioning imply increased market stability.</li>
  <li>Recovery in US Capex Intent from a contractionary phase to neutral suggests some stabilization in business investment, providing a potential floor for growth.</li>
  <li>Continued underlying industrial demand strength, as indicated by the "Demand_Tailwind" in global metals, supports cyclically sensitive sectors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Key Downside / Deterioration Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Emerging fragility in US consumer credit due to rising loan delinquencies poses a direct risk to broader credit conditions and consumer spending.</li>
  <li>Persistent decelerating broader macro momentum globally, particularly in rate-sensitive sectors, despite industrial resilience, could lead to a wider economic slowdown.</li>
  <li>Targeted positioning risks, such as Nasdaq's bearish reversal risk and persistent "Supply_Stress" in key commodities, represent idiosyncratic vulnerabilities despite normalizing systemic volatility.</li>
