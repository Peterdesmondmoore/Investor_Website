<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overarching US inflation environment is characterised by persistent disinflationary pressures across realized price indices, with market expectations remaining largely stable. The Fed Inflation Signal indicates a COOL regime (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/fed-inflation-signal" target="_blank">1</a>), driven by weak inflation momentum. While policy-relevant PCE measures are Neutral (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/policy-relevant-pce-inflation" target="_blank">2</a>), the CPI-PPI divergence has moved towards a neutral stance, suggesting easing cost-push pressures or their limited pass-through to consumers (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/cpi-ppi-divergence" target="_blank">3</a>). Market-implied expectations remain STABLE (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/market-implied-inflation-expectations" target="_blank">4</a>), aligning with a Neutral inflation term-structure (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/inflation-term-structure" target="_blank">5</a>), despite the broad disinflationary backdrop.</p>
<p>Labour market dynamics show some normalisation, with the Wage Growth and Inflation Composite registering a NEUTRAL regime (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/wage-growth-and-inflation-composite" target="_blank">6</a>), primarily due to a notable easing in labor tightness. This suggests reduced wage-driven inflation risks, but the persistence of core inflation at certain levels remains a point of observation.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Realised Inflation:</strong> The composite Fed Inflation signal is in a COOL regime, with its score at 20.24 on a 0-100 scale, indicating weak inflation pressure (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/fed-inflation-signal" target="_blank">1</a>). CPI-PPI divergence has shifted to NEUTRAL, moving from prior disinflationary pressures towards a more balanced outlook (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/cpi-ppi-divergence" target="_blank">3</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Policy-Relevant Inflation:</strong> Headline PCE and Core PCE are near 2.79% and 2.83% year-over-year respectively, keeping the Policy-Relevant PCE signal in a Neutral regime (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/policy-relevant-pce-inflation" target="_blank">2</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Inflation Expectations:</strong> Market-implied inflation expectations (MIIE) are STABLE, with 5-year and 10-year breakevens at 2.27% and 2.24% respectively (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/market-implied-inflation-expectations" target="_blank">4</a>). The inflation term-structure also registers as Neutral (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/inflation-term-structure" target="_blank">5</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Wage &amp; Labour Tightness:</strong> The Wage Growth and Inflation Composite is NEUTRAL, primarily influenced by a decline in labour market tightness, suggesting easing cost-push pressures (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/wage-growth-and-inflation-composite" target="_blank">6</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Overall Risk Bias:</strong> The predominant bias is towards sustained disinflation, with expectations largely anchored, though recent CPI-PPI normalisation bears watching for potential re-acceleration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Realised Inflation: CPI–PPI Dynamics</h3>
<p>The CPI-PPI Divergence signal is currently in a NEUTRAL regime as of November 30, 2025 (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/cpi-ppi-divergence" target="_blank">3</a>). The latest data show a positive PPI-minus-CPI Year-over-Year differential of 0.89%, with a robust divergence z-score of 0.22 (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/cpi-ppi-divergence" target="_blank">3</a>). This indicates a shift from a prolonged period of negative divergence, suggesting a normalisation or reversal of earlier disinflationary pressures. The move is primarily driven by PPI YoY at 3.61% outpacing CPI YoY at 2.71% (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/cpi-ppi-divergence" target="_blank">3</a>). The 3-month change in this divergence, at 1.23%, confirms recent upward momentum, implying emerging cost-push pressures or improved pricing power that is not yet fully transmitted to consumer prices (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/cpi-ppi-divergence" target="_blank">3</a>). This neutral stance suggests a more balanced outlook for pipeline pressures compared to prior periods of cost relief or significant cost-push acceleration.</p>

<h3>2. Policy-Relevant Inflation: PCE &amp; Core PCE</h3>
<p>As of September 30, 2025, the Policy-Relevant Inflation (PCE) signal is in a Neutral regime, with its composite z-score at -0.34 (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/policy-relevant-pce-inflation" target="_blank">2</a>). Headline PCE year-over-year inflation is recorded at 2.79%, while Core PCE (excluding food and energy) is at 2.83% (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/policy-relevant-pce-inflation" target="_blank">2</a>). Both measures, crucial for the central bank’s inflation assessment, are situated within the neutral range, indicating that inflation is near its historical trend and does not currently exhibit strong hot or cool characteristics (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/policy-relevant-pce-inflation" target="_blank">2</a>). This suggests a data-dependent policy stance without immediate signals of extreme inflationary or deflationary deviations from the target, though specific differences from CPI, such as shelter weight, may influence the overall perception of price dynamics.</p>

<h3>3. Market-Implied Inflation Expectations</h3>
<p>Market-implied inflation expectations (MIIE) are currently in a STABLE regime, reflected by a composite z-score of 0.00 and a score of 57.99 on a 0-100 scale (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/market-implied-inflation-expectations" target="_blank">4</a>). As of December 31, 2025, the 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation (T5YIE) stands at 2.27% and the 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T10YIE) is at 2.24% (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/market-implied-inflation-expectations" target="_blank">4</a>). While the absolute levels of breakevens contribute to a moderate market expectation, negative year-over-year z-scores for both T5YIE (-0.42) and T10YIE (-0.42) indicate recent negative momentum, offsetting positive level contributions and keeping the MIIE composite near neutral (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/market-implied-inflation-expectations" target="_blank">4</a>). This implies that markets anticipate future inflation to remain anchored, despite some recent shifts in momentum. The stability in market expectations is broadly consistent with the neutral PCE readings but contrasts with the Fed Inflation Signal's COOL regime.</p>

<h3>4. Term-Structure of Inflation</h3>
<p>The Inflation Term-Structure signal registers a Neutral regime as of December 31, 2025, with its composite z-score at -0.36 (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/inflation-term-structure" target="_blank">5</a>). This neutral state is primarily driven by moderately negative z-scores across its components: the 5-year breakeven z-score at -0.43, the 10-year breakeven z-score at -0.47, and the inverted real yield z-score at -0.14 (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/inflation-term-structure" target="_blank">5</a>). The 5-year and 10-year breakevens are currently 2.27% and 2.24% respectively, with the 10-year TIPS yield at 1.88% (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/inflation-term-structure" target="_blank">5</a>). The recent negative momentum in the composite, moving from -0.09 in October to -0.36 in December, suggests a slight deepening within the neutral band (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/inflation-term-structure" target="_blank">5</a>). This indicates that the market is not currently pricing in a significant re-acceleration or prolonged disinflation over the medium to long term, consistent with an overall balanced, data-dependent narrative.</p>

<h3>5. Wage Growth, Labour Tightness &amp; Cost-Push Pressures</h3>
<p>The Wage Growth and Inflation Composite signal is currently in a NEUTRAL regime as of October 1, 2025, with a composite z-score of -0.55 (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/wage-growth-and-inflation-composite" target="_blank">6</a>). This assessment indicates moderate disinflationary pressure stemming from the labour market. The primary driver of this trend is a notable decline in Labor Tightness, with its z-score dropping to -0.74 (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/wage-growth-and-inflation-composite" target="_blank">6</a>). In contrast, the Wage Pressure component has remained relatively stable at -0.36, suggesting that while labour market slack is increasing, wage growth has not decelerated proportionally (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/wage-growth-and-inflation-composite" target="_blank">6</a>). This dynamic points to easing cost-push inflation pressures from the labour market, which aligns with broader disinflationary forces, but implies some stickiness in wage components.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesis: US Inflation Regime Assessment</h3>
<p>The current US inflation landscape presents a nuanced picture, characterized by disinflationary trends in realized prices and neutral expectations from markets and policy-relevant measures. The overall Fed Inflation Signal registers a COOL regime (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/fed-inflation-signal" target="_blank">1</a>), indicating a broad loss of inflationary momentum. However, this is partially offset by a CPI-PPI divergence that has normalised to NEUTRAL, suggesting a potential re-emergence of pipeline pressures or improved pricing power at the producer level (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/cpi-ppi-divergence" target="_blank">3</a>). Policy-relevant PCE inflation metrics remain Neutral (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/policy-relevant-pce-inflation" target="_blank">2</a>), while market-implied expectations and the inflation term-structure are also STABLE and Neutral respectively (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/market-implied-inflation-expectations" target="_blank">4</a>)(<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/inflation-term-structure" target="_blank">5</a>), reflecting anchored long-term outlooks.</p>
<p>Labour market dynamics further support a moderating inflation outlook, with the Wage Growth and Inflation Composite in a NEUTRAL regime, primarily driven by easing labour tightness (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/wage-growth-and-inflation-composite" target="_blank">6</a>). This comprehensive assessment points towards an environment where headline inflation is receding, but with underlying components like services (reflected in core PCE) and potential cost-push from producers maintaining a neutral stance. The conflict between the broad COOL signal and the STABLE market expectations and Neutral policy-relevant measures highlights a key tension in the inflation narrative.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>
<h4>Upside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A sustained positive shift in the CPI-PPI divergence could indicate strengthening producer pricing power eventually passing through to consumers (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/cpi-ppi-divergence" target="_blank">3</a>).</li>
  <li>Unexpected resilience in core services inflation, potentially reflected in sticky Core PCE readings, could keep overall inflation elevated (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/policy-relevant-pce-inflation" target="_blank">2</a>).</li>
  <li>Renewed external shocks, such as an energy price surge, could impact front-end inflation and potentially spill over into broader price expectations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Further deceleration in the broader Fed Inflation Signal, potentially pushing into a deeper COOL regime, would reinforce disinflationary trends (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/fed-inflation-signal" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li>A more pronounced weakening in labour market tightness, leading to a faster deceleration in wage growth, would ease cost-push pressures (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/wage-growth-and-inflation-composite" target="_blank">6</a>).</li>
  <li>A persistent decline in market-implied inflation expectations, leading to a "FALLING" MIIE regime, could signal weakening demand and disinflationary pressures (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signals/market-implied-inflation-expectations" target="_blank">4</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>An environment characterized by receding headline inflation, COOL general inflation pressure, and STABLE market expectations typically implies a more accommodative stance for central banks, potentially supporting duration-sensitive assets. Fixed income markets may see nominal yields stabilize or decline as inflation premiums decrease, especially if real yields remain constrained by growth concerns. Credit spreads may tighten if disinflation is accompanied by stable growth, avoiding recessionary fears.</p>
<p>For equities, this regime could favor growth-oriented sectors, as disinflation reduces discount rates and benefits companies with long-duration earnings. However, a significant slowdown in demand leading to outright deflationary risks would introduce headwinds. Real assets and inflation hedges might experience reduced tailwinds compared to periods of high or accelerating inflation, though specific commodities could still react to supply-side shocks. Overall risk appetite tends to be supported when inflation is manageable and expectations are anchored, providing clarity for long-term planning.</p>

Providing this signal would allow for a more integrated assessment of inflation within the current macro-economic phase.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Policy-Relevant Inflation (PCE) signal</strong> data (latest as of 2025-09-30) and <strong>Wage Growth and Inflation Signal</strong> data (latest as of 2025-10-01) are older than other provided signals (e.g., Fed Inflation, MIIE, Term-Structure, all as of 2025-12-31). Providing the most recent data for all signals would ensure the analysis reflects the latest market and economic conditions.</li>
  <li>Detailed <strong>component contributions or breakdown for the Fed Inflation Signal</strong> beyond its composite score would enhance the analysis by allowing specific drivers (e.g., CPI, breakevens, money supply) to be explicitly linked to the overall regime and recent trends. While mentioned in the summary, specific numerical contributions for the latest period were not explicitly available.</li>
