<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overarching US inflation regime is currently classified as COOL, reflecting significant disinflationary pressure across the composite signal as of late 2025. While market-implied inflation expectations remain STABLE, underlying realised inflation metrics and wage dynamics exhibit tendencies towards moderation.</p>
<p>This market state indicates a broad unwinding of previous inflationary conditions, though some upstream price pressures remain evident, and policy-relevant inflation measures sit in a neutral, albeit disinflationary, band.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Realised inflation (overall composite) indicates a COOL regime, signalling disinflation or deflation risk.</li>
  <li>Market-implied expectations are STABLE and anchored, showing mild deceleration without extreme shifts.</li>
  <li>Wage and labour dynamics suggest easing cost-push pressures, with the composite in a NEUTRAL regime.</li>
  <li>A divergence exists between PPI and CPI, where producer prices outpace consumer prices, indicating potential upstream pressure within a broadly neutral framework.</li>
  <li>Overall inflation risk bias is skewed towards disinflation, with a monitored potential for re-emerging cost-push factors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Realised Inflation: CPI–PPI Dynamics</h3>
<p>As of November 30, 2025, the CPI year-on-year rate registered 2.50%, while the PPI year-on-year rate stood at 3.61%. This resulted in a positive PPI-CPI divergence of 1.10%.</p>
<p>The robust z-score for this divergence is 0.254704, positioning the signal in a NEUTRAL regime. This indicates that while producer prices are increasing faster than consumer prices, suggesting potential upstream cost-push pressures, the current divergence level is not historically extreme and does not signal an immediate 'Hot' inflationary environment.</p>
<p>This neutral state marks a transition from the 'COOL' disinflationary regime observed in mid-2023 and remains well below the extreme positive z-scores of the 'HOT' regime prevalent in 2021-2022.</p>

<h3>2. Policy-Relevant Inflation: PCE &amp; Core PCE</h3>
<p>For September 30, 2025, the Headline PCE year-on-year rate was 2.7874%, and Core PCE year-on-year stood at 2.8251%. The PCE Composite signal, which equally weights headline and core PCE, registered a z-score of -0.335789, placing it in a Neutral regime.</p>
<p>Both headline and core PCE z-scores are negative, indicating that current inflation levels are below their rolling 60-month medians. However, these readings remain above the -0.75 threshold defined for a "Cool" regime, suggesting a disinflationary trend rather than rapid deceleration.</p>
<p>This neutral positioning suggests policy-relevant inflation is neither signalling sustained above-trend pressure nor an immediate risk of significant undershoot of the central bank’s target, despite a clear trend of moderation.</p>

<h3>3. Market-Implied Inflation Expectations</h3>
<p>As of December 31, 2025, the 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate (T5YIE) is 2.32%, and the 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T10YIE) is 2.26%. The Market-Implied Inflation Expectations (MIIE) composite indicates a STABLE regime, with a z-score of 0.087041.</p>
<p>This stable regime suggests that market participants expect inflation to remain well-anchored, with no extreme stretch or crowding in expectations. While recent 3-month annualised changes for both T5YIE and T10YIE show slight negative z-scores, implying modest deceleration, these are not significant enough to shift the overall expectations into a 'Falling' regime.</p>
<p>Market pricing is broadly consistent with a scenario of contained inflation, sitting near historical averages relative to recent volatility, and not signalling renewed inflation risk or rapid disinflation in the medium to long term.</p>

<h3>4. Term-Structure of Inflation</h3>
<p>The inflation term-structure, as of December 31, 2025, is in a Neutral regime, with a composite score of -0.261040. The 5-year breakeven inflation rate is 2.32%, and the 10-year breakeven inflation rate is 2.26%.</p>
<p>The 10-year breakeven z-score is -0.378661, indicating it is moderately below its rolling median. The inverted 10-year TIPS real yield (DFII10), with a z-score of -0.136183, suggests marginally tighter financial conditions. This overall neutral classification is consistent with stable market expectations and does not imply an extreme Reflation or Disinflationary environment.</p>

<h3>5. Wage Growth, Labour Tightness &amp; Cost-Push Pressures</h3>
<p>The Wage Growth & Inflation Composite, which blends wage pressure and labour market tightness, registered a smoothed z-score of -0.595283 as of October 1, 2025, placing it in a NEUTRAL regime. This indicates below-median cost-push pressures when assessed through this composite lens.</p>
<p>Individually, the Wage Pressure z-score was -0.705149 (as of April 1, 2025, which applies to later months due to data frequency), indicating a cooling trend in wage growth. The Labor Market Tightness z-score also showed a significant unwind from March 2025 to -0.735808 by October 1, 2025. These components, while still within the neutral band for the composite, are nearing the thresholds that would signal a 'COOL' regime independently.</p>
<p>The current dynamics suggest easing cost-push inflation pressures from the labour market, consistent with a normalising labour environment rather than one of persistent tightness or accelerating wage growth.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesis: US Inflation Regime Assessment</h3>
<p>The overall US inflation profile is currently characterized by a "COOL" regime, as indicated by the primary Fed Inflation Signal composite. This signals a broad disinflationary environment, significantly moderated from previous inflationary peaks.</p>
<p>While policy-relevant PCE inflation metrics remain in a "Neutral" band, they show a clear trend below their historical medians. Market-implied expectations are "STABLE," suggesting that participants are pricing in an anchored inflation path rather than a re-acceleration. Concurrently, wage and labour market pressures, while composite "Neutral," exhibit underlying cooling trends. The CPI-PPI divergence points to some upstream cost pressure, yet its current level remains within a "Neutral" historical range. The inflation term structure also reflects a "Neutral" outlook.</p>
<p>Collectively, the signals point to a period of disinflation where underlying cost pressures are easing, and expectations remain relatively well-behaved, preventing a return to an "Hot" regime, but also not indicating an abrupt "Cooling" across all measures simultaneously.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>
<h4>Upside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Persistent positive CPI-PPI divergence, if sustained or widening, could transmit into consumer prices, reversing current disinflationary trends.</li>
  <li>A re-acceleration in aggregate demand could prevent further normalisation of labour market tightness, potentially reigniting wage growth.</li>
  <li>Renewed energy or commodity price shocks, not fully captured by current expectations, could quickly shift short-term inflation dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Downside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Faster-than-expected normalisation of labour market conditions and continued moderation in wage growth could lead to more pronounced disinflation.</li>
  <li>A significant weakening in consumer demand, not currently signalled, could accelerate disinflation across goods and services.</li>
  <li>Market-implied inflation expectations, while stable, could shift towards a 'Falling' regime if persistent disinflationary forces materialise, potentially unanchoring longer-term expectations downwards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>An inflation regime characterized by a "COOL" composite signal, with "Neutral" policy-relevant inflation and "Stable" expectations, generally implies an environment conducive to fixed income assets, particularly those sensitive to interest rate declines as disinflation reduces pressure on central banks. Duration may become more attractive as inflation risk diminishes.</p>
<p>Equities might face mixed performance, with growth stocks potentially benefiting from lower discount rates, while value sectors could be challenged by reduced pricing power. Real assets and traditional inflation hedges may see diminished demand in a disinflationary environment, unless specific commodity supply shocks or geopolitical risks emerge to offset the broader trend. Risk appetite may be supported by easing monetary policy expectations but moderated by concerns over underlying economic growth that would drive deeper disinflation.</div></section>
