  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><p><em>Synthesising realised inflation, price indices, wage costs, and market-implied expectations.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The prevailing US inflation regime indicates a disinflationary trend, with the overarching composite signal registering in a "COOL" state for November 2025. This reflects a broad unwinding of inflationary pressures observed in early 2022.</p>
<p>While realised inflation measures (CPI, PCE) continue to show values near or slightly above the central bank's target and remain in a "Neutral" regime, market-implied expectations are "Stable" with notable short-term downside momentum. Wage growth and labour market tightness also reflect normalising or "Cool" conditions, contributing to the disinflationary narrative.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Realised inflation, as measured by the CPI-PPI divergence and PCE, remains largely neutral or above target but is not signalling re-acceleration.</li>
  <li>Market-implimplied inflation expectations are anchored but exhibit negative short-term momentum.</li>
  <li>Wage and labour tightness indicators point to a normalising or cooling environment, alleviating cost-push pressures.</li>
  <li>The overall inflation risk bias is tilted towards disinflation, despite some components remaining neutral.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Realised Inflation: CPI–PPI Dynamics</h3>
<p>As of October 2025, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) registered a 2.79% Year-over-Year (YoY) increase, while the Producer Price Index (PPI) advanced by 3.66% YoY. The divergence between PPI and CPI, with PPI rising faster, results in a positive z-score of 0.234151. This indicates some potential for cost-push pressure from producers, yet the signal remains within the "NEUTRAL" regime, not indicating extreme or historically anomalous conditions.</p>
<p>The current spread suggests that while producer costs are increasing faster than consumer prices, the magnitude is not indicative of an imminent significant re-acceleration in broad consumer inflation based on this metric's historical context.</p>

<h3>2. Policy-Relevant Inflation: PCE &amp; Core PCE</h3>
<p>For August 2025, headline Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation was 2.74% YoY, and Core PCE (excluding food and energy) was 2.91% YoY. The composite signal for policy-relevant inflation recorded a z-score of -0.321531, placing it firmly in a "Neutral" regime. Both headline and core PCE measures remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, indicating persistent, albeit moderated, inflationary pressures in areas considered by the central bank. The "Neutral" regime classification suggests that, while inflation is above target, it is not accelerating significantly away from its historical trend in a manner that would trigger an immediate "Hot" signal.</p>

<h3>3. Market-Implied Inflation Expectations</h3>
<p>Market-Implied Inflation Expectations (MIIE) indicate a "STABLE" regime as of November 2025, with a composite z-score of 0.034273. This suggests that market participants' medium- to long-term inflation expectations are anchored near their historical averages. However, a more granular view reveals that 3-month annualised momentum indicators for both 5-year and 10-year breakevens (T5YIE_ann3m_z: -0.820327, T10YIE_ann3m_z: -1.094457) are showing negative z-scores, signalling short-term downside pressure in expectations. This indicates that while the absolute level of expectations is stable, the recent trajectory has been disinflationary.</p>

<h3>4. Term-Structure of Inflation</h3>
<p>The Inflation Term-Structure Composite registered a value of -0.315806 for November 2025, maintaining a "Neutral" regime. This signal, which blends 5-year and 10-year breakeven inflation rates with the inverted 10-year real TIPS yield, indicates that the inflation curve is not signalling extreme reflationary or disinflationary conditions. Both 5-year (Z_T5: -0.357561) and 10-year (Z_T10: -0.486518) breakevens show negative z-scores relative to their rolling medians, suggesting a slight disinflationary bias. The inverted real yield (Z_mReal: -0.089421) is near its median, implying financial conditions are not excessively tight or loose from this perspective. The overall term structure is consistent with a normalising inflation environment rather than a strong re-acceleration or deep disinflationary spiral.</p>

<h3>5. Wage Growth, Labour Tightness &amp; Cost-Push Pressures</h3>
<p>The Wage Growth and Inflation Composite, which incorporates both wage pressure and labour market tightness, was in a "NEUTRAL" regime as of August 2025, with a smoothed z-score of -0.526283. Although the composite itself is neutral, the underlying Wage Pressure component has shown significant cooling, having entered a "COOL" regime earlier in 2025 with a z-score of -1.162677 in January 2025, and currently at -0.705149 for August 2025. Labour Tightness (z-score of -0.449661 in August 2025) also indicates a normalising trend. These dynamics imply a reduction in cost-push inflationary pressures originating from the labour market, suggesting that wage-price spirals are not currently a dominant factor in the inflation outlook.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesis: US Inflation Regime Assessment</h3>
<p>The US inflation environment is best characterised as being in a "Normalising Disinflationary Trend." The broad Fed Inflation Signal composite indicates a "COOL" regime, reflecting a significant unwinding from the "HOT" periods of 2021-2022. This is supported by cooling wage pressures and a term structure of inflation that, while neutral, exhibits a disinflationary bias from its breakeven components.</p>
<p>However, realised inflation metrics (CPI, PCE) continue to show prices running above the Federal Reserve's target, maintaining a "Neutral" regime status rather than "Cooling." Market-implied expectations, despite being "Stable," have seen negative momentum in the short term. This suggests a nuanced environment where the trajectory is disinflationary, but actual price levels remain elevated, preventing a full return to pre-pandemic inflation norms.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>
<h4>Upside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Persistent positive CPI-PPI divergence, where producer price increases eventually feed through more aggressively to consumer prices.</li>
  <li>PCE and Core PCE consistently remaining above the 2% target, leading to potential recalibration of inflation expectations.</li>
  <li>Unexpected external shocks, such as renewed energy price spikes or supply chain disruptions, not fully captured by current market expectations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Further cooling in wage growth and labour market tightness, translating into reduced services inflation.</li>
  <li>Continued negative momentum in market-implied inflation expectations, leading to a deeper anchoring of disinflationary sentiment.</li>
  <li>A sharper-than-anticipated slowdown in economic activity, dampening aggregate demand and price pressures.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>A "Normalising Disinflationary Trend" regime typically implies a market environment where central bank policy may shift from restrictive to neutral or accommodative, depending on the pace of disinflation and economic growth. This scenario could generally be supportive of fixed income assets as inflation expectations moderate, potentially leading to lower long-term yields. Equity markets might face a mixed environment; growth stocks could benefit from lower discount rates, while cyclical sectors might be sensitive to the underlying economic slowdown implied by disinflation. Real assets and inflation-hedging strategies may experience reduced demand in such an environment, given the easing of price pressures. Credit markets could see improved sentiment as the risk of aggressive policy tightening diminishes, provided economic growth remains resilient.</p></div></section>
