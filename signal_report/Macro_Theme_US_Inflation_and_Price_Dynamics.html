  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Current inflation momentum indicates a predominantly disinflationary trend or a state of moderate and stable price pressures. Aggregate measures have shifted from previously elevated "HOT" regimes to "COOL" or "NEUTRAL" classifications across several key indicators over the past year. This environment is characterized by decelerating inflation across headline and core metrics.</p>
<p>The breadth of price pressures across components is notably contained. Market-implied inflation expectations remain anchored in a "STABLE" or "Neutral" regime, and labor cost dynamics, as reflected by the Wage Growth & Inflation Composite, are also in a "NEUTRAL" state. While some upstream cost pressures are observed in producer prices, these have not translated into an accelerating consumer price environment.</p>
<p>Overall, the inflation environment is in a state of deceleration or stabilization. There is no current indication of broad re-acceleration in either realized inflation data or forward-looking market expectations.</p>

<h2>Aggregate Inflation State</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Headline Inflation:</strong> The Fed Inflation Signal registers a "COOL" regime, with a composite score of -0.014734 (20.21 on a 0-100 scale) as of 2025-11-30. CPI year-on-year for October 2025 was 2.79%.</li>
  <li><strong>Core Inflation:</strong> Policy-Relevant Core PCE year-on-year for August 2025 was 2.91%, with the PCE Composite maintaining a "Neutral" regime at -0.321531.</li>
  <li><strong>Producer Price Dynamics:</strong> PPI year-on-year for October 2025 was 3.66%. The PPI-CPI divergence signal is "NEUTRAL," despite PPI growing faster than CPI, indicating some upstream pressure but not a "HOT" environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Services vs Goods Inflation:</strong> Not specifically indicated by available data; however, PCE and CPI measures encompass both categories.</li>
  <li><strong>Market-Implied Inflation Expectations:</strong> The Market-Implied Inflation Expectations (MIIE) Composite is in a "STABLE" regime (z-score 0.034273) as of 2025-11-30. The Inflation Term-Structure signal is "Neutral" (composite -0.315806) as of 2025-11-30.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall inflation environment is characterized by broad disinflationary momentum or stable, moderate price pressures, consistently operating below previous elevated levels.</p>

<h2>Market-Implied Inflation Expectations</h2>
<p>Longer-term inflation expectations, as inferred from TIPS breakevens, are currently categorized as "STABLE" by the Market-Implied Inflation Expectations (MIIE) Composite (z-score 0.034273 as of 2025-11-30). The 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate (T5YIE) is 2.29%, and the 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T10YIE) is 2.23%.</p>
<p>Expectations are stable, slightly above their long-term median but lack significant upward momentum. The current state reflects an anchoring of longer-term expectations, consistent with a moderation in inflation concerns. This aligns with realized inflation indicators, which also show disinflationary or neutral trends.</p>
<p>A notable regime change is evident, transitioning from "RISING" expectations observed in early 2021-2022 to the current "STABLE" regime.</p>

<h2>Inflation Term Structure</h2>
<p>The Inflation Term-Structure signal indicates a "Neutral" regime, with a composite score of -0.315806 as of 2025-11-30. The 5-year breakeven inflation rate is 2.29%, and the 10-year breakeven is 2.23%, resulting in a slightly inverted term spread of -0.06% (10YIE - 5YIE).</p>
<p>This slightly inverted gradient suggests that short-term inflation expectations are marginally higher than longer-term expectations, reflecting a cautious but not alarmed market outlook. There is no evidence of widespread repricing or de-anchoring of inflation expectations within the term structure.</p>
<p>The curve gradient suggests that inflation is more likely to be transitory or to persist at moderate levels rather than to undergo a sustained re-acceleration. This interpretation is consistent with recent realized inflation data, which predominantly indicate disinflationary or neutral trends.</p>

<h2>Price Indices & Producer Costs (CPI vs PPI)</h2>
<p>The latest data for October 2025 indicates a Consumer Price Index (CPI) year-on-year increase of 2.79% and a Producer Price Index (PPI) year-on-year increase of 3.66%. The resulting PPI-CPI divergence is 0.87% (PPI > CPI), placing the divergence signal in a "NEUTRAL" regime (robust z-score of 0.234151).</p>
<p>This positive divergence implies some upstream cost pressure for producers, which could impact corporate profit margins if not fully passed through. However, the "NEUTRAL" regime classification suggests that firms are either absorbing these input costs or passing them on at a rate that keeps consumer price inflation moderate, preventing a "HOT" inflationary environment.</p>
<p>The trend strength indicates a stabilization of price dynamics within the neutral zone, following a period of "COOL" disinflation, suggesting a moderation of input cost pressures from earlier elevated levels.</p>

<h2>Wage Growth & Labour Cost Pressure</h2>
<p>The Wage Growth & Inflation Composite indicates a "NEUTRAL" regime (composite z-score of -0.577405 as of August 2025). This is supported by a "NEUTRAL" Wage Pressure z-score of -0.705149 and a "NEUTRAL" Labor Tightness z-score of -0.449661 for the same period.</p>
<p>Wage dynamics show moderate private industry wage and salary growth year-on-year at 3.5% and civilian worker wage and salary growth at 3.6% as of April 2025. This moderate wage growth, combined with neutral labor market tightness, suggests a reduced risk of a reinforcing wage-price spiral.</p>
<p>Labor cost pressures are considered broad-based but contained within a neutral range, not signaling elevated inflationary risk from the labor market. The composite z-score has shown a trend of becoming less negative since September 2024, indicating a potential waning of disinflationary momentum from this sector.</p>

<h2>Policy-Relevant Inflation (PCE Focus)</h2>
<p>Core PCE behavior is currently reflected by a "Neutral" regime for the PCE Composite (score -0.321531 as of August 2025). Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) year-on-year was 2.91%, and Headline PCE year-on-year was 2.74% for the same period.</p>
<p>While the core PCE year-on-year rate is above a nominal 2% target, the composite's "Neutral" classification indicates that the deviation is not severe enough to trigger an alarm for policy action, suggesting a data-dependent, less hawkish monetary policy stance. The composite has maintained a "Neutral" regime consistently over the past year, ranging from -0.58 to -0.28.</p>
<p>Trends indicate a moderation in disinflationary forces, with a slight rise in the composite from its April 2025 low, but without re-acceleration into a "Hot" regime. No distinct turning points into "Hot" or "Cool" regimes have been visible in the last year, suggesting stability within this central zone.</p>

<h2>Cross-Signal Synthesis</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reinforcing Signals:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The Fed Inflation Signal (COOL) and the Policy-Relevant PCE Composite (Neutral) both indicate an environment of either disinflationary momentum or stable, moderate price pressures.</li>
      <li>Market-Implied Inflation Expectations (STABLE) and the Inflation Term-Structure (Neutral) suggest that longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored, aligning with a disinflationary or moderate inflation outlook.</li>
      <li>The Wage Growth & Inflation Composite (NEUTRAL) corroborates the absence of significant re-acceleration risk stemming from labor costs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Conflicting Signals:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The Producer Price Index (PPI) year-on-year (3.66%) exceeding the Consumer Price Index (CPI) year-on-year (2.79%) indicates some upstream price pressure. While the CPI vs PPI divergence signal remains "NEUTRAL," this divergence represents a mild conflict with the broader disinflationary/neutral narrative, suggesting potential for future consumer price pressure if producers fully pass on costs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Breadth vs. Concentration of Inflation Pressure:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Inflationary pressures are broad-based in their disinflationary or neutral character, affecting realized inflation, market expectations, and labor costs. There is no evidence of concentrated inflationary pressure in any single component that strongly contradicts the overall trend.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Short-Term vs. Medium-Term Inflation Risks:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Short-term indicators, such as the 3-month annualized z-scores within Market-Implied Inflation Expectations, suggest an easing bias. This is consistent with medium-term views, where 5-year and 10-year breakevens remain stable within a neutral range, implying no immediate or significant medium-term re-inflationary risks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Watchpoints (Forward-Looking Conditions)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A sustained shift in the Fed Inflation Signal from its current "COOL" regime to "NEUTRAL" or "HOT," indicating a re-emergence of broad inflationary pressures.</li>
  <li>An upward trend in the Market-Implied Inflation Expectations (MIIE) Composite, leading to a transition from the "STABLE" regime to "RISING," signaling market concern over future inflation.</li>
  <li>A significant and persistent widening of the PPI-CPI divergence (PPI much greater than CPI), pushing the CPI vs PPI signal into a "HOT" regime, indicating strong pass-through of producer costs to consumers.</li>
  <li>An increase in the Wage Growth & Inflation Composite, causing a shift from its "NEUTRAL" regime to "HOT," suggesting a material acceleration in labor cost pressures and a heightened risk of a wage-price feedback loop.</li>
  <li>The Policy-Relevant PCE Composite moving from its "Neutral" regime into "Hot" territory, signaling sustained above-trend inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate.</li>
  <li>A substantial steepening of the breakeven inflation term structure, particularly driven by a rapid rise in longer-term expectations relative to shorter-term expectations, indicating a de-anchoring risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The prevailing market state for inflation is characterized by disinflationary momentum or a stable, moderate inflationary environment. Key aggregate and component-level indicators, including realized price indices, market-implied expectations, and labor cost measures, consistently reflect a move away from previously elevated inflationary pressures towards either declining trends or maintained neutrality.</p>
<p>The persistence of inflation is currently assessed as moderate, with no strong signals indicating a re-acceleration or an imminent return to a "HOT" regime. This suggests that the current inflation regime is more stable than fragile, reflecting either successful disinflationary forces or a period of consolidation at a higher, yet contained, baseline.</p>
<p>While the available data does not explicitly delineate structural versus cyclical components, the broad-based moderation across diverse signals implies a comprehensive easing of price pressures, whether originating from supply-side corrections or demand-side adjustments.</p>

<h2>Model & Signal Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Missing Inflation Indicators:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Granular services inflation data (e.g., ex-housing services).</li>
      <li>Owner's Equivalent Rent (OER) or other housing-specific inflation measures.</li>
      <li>Detailed global commodity price indices and global supply chain pressure indices.</li>
      <li>Consumer and business inflation expectations from surveys (e.g., University of Michigan, NFIB).</li>
      <li>Inflation swap rates across various tenors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Suggested Enhancements to Signal Construction or Prompt Logic:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorporate dynamic weighting mechanisms for composite signals, allowing weights to adapt based on prevailing market volatility or economic regimes.</li>
      <li>Develop a dedicated "Services vs Goods" inflation signal, possibly by disaggregating CPI or PCE components.</li>
      <li>Integrate forward-looking components into the Policy-Relevant PCE composite, such as 1-year ahead market-implied PCE.</li>
      <li>Expand the CPI vs PPI divergence analysis to include core components (ex-food and energy) to filter out transient commodity price shocks.</li>
      <li>Introduce a qualitative sentiment signal derived from textual analysis of central bank communications or economic reports concerning inflation.</li>
    </ul>
