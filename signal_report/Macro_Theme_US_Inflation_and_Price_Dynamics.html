  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><p><em>Synthesising realised inflation, price indices, wage costs, and market-implied expectations.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The overarching US inflation landscape is currently categorised by a "COOL" regime, as indicated by the composite Fed Inflation Signal as of late 2025. This reflects a broad-based moderation in inflation pressures across various components, marking a notable shift from previous periods of elevated inflation.</p>
<p>While realised inflation metrics (CPI, PCE) sit within a neutral range, market-implied expectations remain stable, and labour-market cost pressures are easing. The current environment suggests a persistent disinflationary bias with expectations largely anchored.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Realised inflation (CPI and PCE) indicates neutral conditions, with year-over-year growth rates below 3%.</li>
  <li>Market-implied inflation expectations are stable, exhibiting recent cooling momentum in shorter-term breakevens.</li>
  <li>Wage growth and labour market tightness signals are in a neutral regime, pointing to decelerating cost-push pressures.</li>
  <li>The inflation term structure also remains in a neutral state, with a moderate disinflationary lean.</li>
  <li>Overall inflation risk maintains a downside bias, consistent with the composite "COOL" signal.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Realised Inflation: CPI–PPI Dynamics</h3>
<p>As of November 2025, the CPI year-on-year (YoY) stood at 2.50%, while the PPI YoY was at 3.61%. This resulted in a divergence where producer prices were rising faster than consumer prices, with the PPI-minus-CPI YoY spread at 1.10%.</p>
<p>The divergence z-score was 0.25, placing the CPI vs PPI signal in a "NEUTRAL" regime. This indicates some pipeline pressure from producer costs but not at historically extreme levels that would suggest an immediate or intense transmission into consumer prices under current conditions.</p>
<p>The current state follows a period where divergence was significantly negative (e.g., mid-2023 "COOL" phase), suggesting a normalisation of price dynamics rather than escalating cost-push pressures.</p>

<h3>2. Policy-Relevant Inflation: PCE &amp; Core PCE</h3>
<p>For September 2025, the PCE price index recorded a year-over-year increase of 2.79%, with the Core PCE (excluding food and energy) showing a 2.83% increase. The composite PCE signal indicated a z-score of -0.336, falling within the "Neutral" regime.</p>
<p>Both headline and core PCE measures are below 3%, reflecting inflation dynamics that are largely consistent with the central bank's inflation target range, without indicating a state of overheating or deep disinflation.</p>
<p>The moderately negative z-scores for both components suggest sustained below-average inflation pressure relative to their historical robust medians.</p>

<h3>3. Market-Implied Inflation Expectations</h3>
<p>Market-implied inflation expectations, as captured by the MIIE signal, were in a "STABLE" regime as of December 2025, with a composite z-score of 0.10. The 5-year breakeven inflation rate (T5YIE) was 2.33%, and the 10-year breakeven inflation rate (T10YIE) was 2.26%.</p>
<p>The 3-month annualised change z-scores for T5YIE (-0.48) and T10YIE (-0.64) signal recent cooling momentum in shorter- to medium-term inflation expectations. This indicates that market participants are pricing in an anchored inflation path with a slight disinflationary bias in the near term.</p>
<p>The overall market pricing is broadly consistent with the observed moderation in realised inflation data and PCE trends, indicating an absence of significant tension between market expectations and current price dynamics.</p>

<h3>4. Term-Structure of Inflation</h3>
<p>As of December 2025, the Inflation Term Composite registered a z-score of -0.243, placing it within a "Neutral" regime. This composite reflects a blend of 5-year and 10-year breakeven inflation rates and the inverted 10-year real TIPS yield.</p>
<p>The individual z-scores for T5YIE (-0.23), T10YIE (-0.38), and the inverted real yield (-0.12) are all moderately negative, suggesting a disinflationary lean across the term structure, but without crossing the thresholds for a "Disinflation" regime.</p>
<p>This configuration is consistent with a stable, moderate inflation path, neither signalling significant reflation risk nor deep disinflationary pressures. The front end shows sensitivity to the broader disinflationary trend.</p>

<h3>5. Wage Growth, Labour Tightness &amp; Cost-Push Pressures</h3>
<p>The Wage Growth & Inflation Composite, which integrates wage pressure and labour market tightness, was in a "NEUTRAL" regime as of August 2025, with a z-score of -0.58. The Wage Pressure component alone was also "NEUTRAL" (z-score -0.71) as of April 2025, having recently transitioned from a "COOL" regime in January 2025 (z-score -1.16).</p>
<p>Labour Market Tightness, a key input, registered a z-score of -0.45 in August 2025, also within the "NEUTRAL" range and showing a general easing from previous periods. This indicates a normalisation of labour market conditions rather than increasing tightness.</p>
<p>Collectively, these signals point to decelerating wage growth and easing labour market tightness, thereby reducing cost-push inflation pressures from the labour segment of the economy.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesis: US Inflation Regime Assessment</h3>
<p>The aggregate "Fed Inflation Signal" currently categorises the US inflation regime as "COOL (disinflation/deflation risk)" as of December 2025. This overarching assessment is supported by a consistent pattern observed across key inflation components.</p>
<p>Realised inflation metrics (CPI, PCE) and market-implied expectations (MIIE, Term Structure) are predominantly in a "Neutral" or "Stable" regime, with a clear disinflationary lean evident in their respective z-scores and recent momentum. Wage growth and labour market tightness indicators also confirm easing cost-push pressures, sitting within a "NEUTRAL" regime and showing signs of deceleration.</p>
<p>This synthesis points to a broad disinflationary environment, where market expectations remain anchored to a moderate inflation path. There is no evidence of widespread inflationary pressures or re-acceleration risk from the composite signals.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>
<h4>Upside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Continued divergence where producer prices exceed consumer prices (CPI vs PPI signal), suggesting potential for future transmission of higher input costs to final consumer prices if sustained or if demand remains resilient.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Downside Risks to Inflation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The composite Fed Inflation Signal residing in a "COOL" regime implies ongoing disinflationary or even deflationary risks.</li>
  <li>Cooling momentum in market-implied inflation expectations, as indicated by negative 3-month annualised z-scores for breakevens.</li>
  <li>Decelerating wage growth and easing labour market tightness (Wage Growth & Inflation Composite), reducing the likelihood of a wage-price spiral.</li>
  <li>Policy-relevant inflation (PCE and Core PCE) consistently tracking below 3% YoY, suggesting limited underlying inflationary pressure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>An overarching "COOL" inflation regime, characterised by moderating realised inflation, stable market expectations, and easing labour cost pressures, typically suggests an environment where fixed income assets, particularly those with longer duration, may find support from potentially lower nominal yields. High-quality credit could benefit from reduced inflation uncertainty and a more stable economic outlook.</p>
<p>In equities, a disinflationary environment with anchored expectations may favour growth stocks over value, as lower discount rates increase the present value of future earnings. Real assets and inflation-hedging instruments might experience reduced demand for their inflation premium. Risk appetite may improve if this disinflationary path is interpreted as conducive to a soft landing, reducing the need for aggressive monetary tightening.</p></div></section>
