  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Federal Reserve Beige Book — Executive Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><h2>The Beige Book Summary (November 2025 Report)</h2>
<h3>National Backdrop</h3>
<p>Overall economic activity was largely unchanged since the prior report, with most Federal Reserve Districts experiencing stable conditions. However, a notable shift occurred as two Districts noted a modest decline while only one reported modest growth, indicating a slight deterioration in the overall growth distribution compared to the previous period where growth was more widespread. Consumer spending declined further nationally, with auto sales notably falling after the expiration of a federal tax credit, exacerbating the "inched down" trend from the prior report. Manufacturing activity, in contrast, saw a modest increase, contrasting with the prior period's varied and challenging conditions, though tariffs and uncertainty remained headwinds. The recent government shutdown impacted consumer purchases and community services, particularly food assistance, adding to economic uncertainty.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Labour Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Employment declined slightly across the nation, marking a shift from the prior period's "largely stable" levels, with approximately half of the Districts reporting softer labor demand. While an uptick in layoff announcements was noted, firms predominantly managed headcounts through hiring freezes, attrition, and replacement-only hiring, often adjusting hours rather than making widespread cuts. Worker availability generally improved, making it easier to find staff, though specific skilled positions and roles affected by immigration policy changes continued to be challenging. Artificial intelligence was explicitly cited as a factor enabling firms to reduce entry-level positions or increase existing worker productivity, thereby curbing new hiring. Wage growth remained modest, but labor cost pressures intensified in manufacturing, construction, and healthcare, partly due to rising health insurance premiums.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Prices & Cost Pressures</h3>
<p>Prices increased moderately, a slight easing from the "rose further" pace observed in the prior report, yet remaining elevated. Input cost pressures continued to be robust and widespread, particularly in manufacturing and retail, with tariffs consistently cited as a primary driver alongside rising insurance, utilities, technology, and health care costs. The ability to pass through these higher costs to customers varied significantly across firms and sectors, leading to reports of margin compression for some, while others anticipated further price increases. Some relief was noted in certain material prices due to sluggish demand or reduced tariff rates. Looking ahead, contacts largely expect cost pressures to persist, though plans for near-term selling price increases were mixed.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Sector Themes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer activity:</strong> Spending declined further, with low- and middle-income consumers becoming more cautious, relying on discounts, and using credit to maintain spending. Higher-end retail remained resilient. Auto sales decreased post-EV tax credit expiration. The government shutdown negatively impacted purchases and discretionary spending.</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Activity increased somewhat, a positive change. Durable goods, primary metals, fabricated metals, machinery, and transportation equipment showed strength. AI data center investments provided a boost for related manufacturers. However, tariffs and trade policy uncertainty continued to temper outlooks and investment.</li>
  <li><strong>Services:</strong> Nonfinancial services activity contracted or was flat. Business services showed mixed demand, with some growth linked to tax law and AI, but general client hesitation on deals. Leisure and hospitality was stable to down, affected by cautious discretionary spending and government shutdown impacts.</li>
  <li><strong>Housing & construction:</strong> Residential real estate eased slightly with declining sales, increased inventory, and softening prices. New home construction remained subdued, with builders offering incentives. Commercial real estate was largely unchanged, though some office markets improved and data center construction remained a bright spot.</li>
  <li><strong>Banking & credit:</strong> Loan demand decreased overall, driven by commercial and industrial lending, but residential mortgages saw slight growth. Credit standards tightened for business loans and commercial mortgages. Overall loan performance deteriorated slightly, with consumer delinquencies rising.</li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture & energy:</strong> Conditions were largely stable but remained weak in some areas, facing low commodity prices, high input costs, and trade policy impacts. Oil and gas activity was flat, with concerns over low oil prices and project delays, though pipeline activity saw optimism.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Regional Dispersion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stronger districts:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Boston:</em> Experienced slight expansion, with renewed strength in home sales and modest manufacturing growth, and a cautiously optimistic outlook.</li>
      <li><em>Chicago:</em> Saw a slight activity increase across multiple sectors including employment, consumer/business spending, construction/real estate, and manufacturing.</li>
      <li><em>Cleveland:</em> Noted a slight business activity increase driven by professional/business services and AI data centers.</li>
      <li><em>Richmond:</em> Continued modest growth, with stable employment and moderate wage/price growth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Softer districts:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>New York:</em> Experienced a modest decline in activity and employment, with consumer spending slightly down, although manufacturing activity increased moderately.</li>
      <li><em>Philadelphia:</em> Reported modest overall declines, exacerbated by the government shutdown, with falling employment and increased price pressures on households.</li>
      <li><em>Minneapolis:</em> Was flat overall, with a slight employment decrease, continued softening labor demand, and lower consumer spending.</li>
      <li><em>Kansas City:</em> Slowed slightly, reflecting softer labor conditions and cooling consumer activity, alongside declining oil and gas activity.</li>
      <li><em>Dallas:</em> Weakened slightly, noting declines in nonfinancial services, retail, and banking, and continued weakness in housing, with employment falling on net.</li>
      <li><em>San Francisco:</em> Conditions were mixed, with retail trade, agriculture, and residential real estate easing slightly, and community support/small businesses weakening.</li>
      <li><em>St. Louis:</em> Remained unchanged in activity, but reported a slowdown in demand amplified by the government shutdown, leading to a slightly pessimistic outlook.</li>
      <li><em>Atlanta:</em> Was little changed on balance, with retail sales and travel slowing, and home sales declining slightly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Common constraints:</strong> Tariffs and trade policy uncertainty were widespread headwinds affecting input costs, manufacturing decisions, and overall business outlooks. General economic uncertainty, rising insurance and healthcare costs, and heightened price sensitivity among low- and middle-income consumers consistently constrained demand. The recent federal government shutdown also broadly impacted activity and community services across several districts. Labor availability for specific skilled positions remained a challenge, compounded by immigration policy changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> Boston's renewed strength in home sales and strong demand for AI infrastructure investments in both Boston and Cleveland stood out against a generally softer or declining residential real estate and investment landscape elsewhere. Kansas City's manufacturing sector showed slight strengthening, particularly in durable goods, contrasting with declines in some other districts.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Signals to Watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth risks:</strong> The impact of the government shutdown and potential future policy uncertainties on demand; the ongoing cautiousness in consumer discretionary spending, particularly among lower- and middle-income households; and the sustained weakness in sectors like agriculture and energy due to low prices and input costs.</li>
  <li><strong>Labour inflections:</strong> Further adoption of AI leading to shifts in workforce composition and reduced demand for entry-level positions; continued reliance on attrition and hiring freezes over active hiring; and persistent challenges in sourcing skilled labor or workers affected by immigration policies despite overall easing in labor availability.</li>
  <li><strong>Inflation persistence:</strong> The continued upward pressure from tariffs, insurance, and healthcare premiums influencing overall input costs; the varied ability of businesses to pass these costs onto consumers, potentially leading to further margin compression or broader price increases; and the expectation among some contacts for price growth to accelerate in the coming months.</li>
  <li><strong>Capital investment:</strong> Businesses' continued hesitation on long-term capital investments due to uncertainty, despite some targeted spending on automation and AI infrastructure; and delays or scaling back of construction projects due to funding constraints or softer demand for certain property types.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial stress:</strong> The ongoing rise in consumer and small business delinquencies and defaults; continued tightening of credit standards by banks, especially for business and commercial real estate loans; and increasing reliance on social services and debt by vulnerable households facing financial strain.</li>
