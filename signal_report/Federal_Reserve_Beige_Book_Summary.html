  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Federal Reserve Beige Book — Executive Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><h2>The Beige Book Summary: November 2025 Update</h2>

<h3>National Backdrop</h3>
<p>Economic activity remained little changed on balance since the previous report, with a slight deceleration as two Districts noted modest declines and only one reported modest growth, compared to a prior period with more Districts reporting slight growth. Consumer spending notably declined further, following a prior "inched down" assessment, as higher-income households maintained resilient spending while lower- and middle-income consumers exhibited increasing caution and financial strain. Retailers cited negative impacts from the recent government shutdown, and auto sales weakened following the expiration of a federal tax credit that had previously boosted demand. Manufacturing activity increased somewhat nationally, an improvement from its prior varied and challenging state, though tariffs persisted as a significant headwind. Nonfinancial services activity remained mostly flat to down, indicating continued softness in the sector. Conditions in the agriculture and energy sectors were largely stable, showing a degree of stabilization compared to being generally down previously, albeit with ongoing challenges from low commodity prices and trade policies.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Labour Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Employment levels declined slightly across the nation, marking a notable softening from the prior period's "largely stable" assessment, with approximately half of Districts reporting weaker labor demand. While an uptick in layoff announcements was observed, most employers preferred to limit headcounts through hiring freezes, replacement-only hiring, and attrition, rather than widespread layoffs. Several firms indicated that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies were replacing entry-level positions or boosting productivity sufficiently to curb new hiring. Employers generally found it easier to secure workers, yet persistent challenges remained for specific skilled positions and due to fewer immigrant workers. Wage growth continued at a modest pace, a slight moderation from the prior "modest to moderate" range, though some sectors, particularly manufacturing, construction, and healthcare, continued to experience moderate wage pressure due to tighter supply. Rising health insurance premiums continued to exert upward pressure on labor costs across industries.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Prices & Cost Pressures</h3>
<p>Prices rose moderately during the reporting period, indicating a slight easing in the pace of increase compared to the prior report's "rose further" assessment. Input cost pressures remained widespread, particularly in manufacturing and retail, largely driven by tariff-induced increases, which contacts in both periods consistently highlighted. Firms also continued to report rising costs for insurance, utilities, technology, and health care services. The extent to which firms could pass through higher costs to customers varied significantly, influenced by demand, competitive pressures, and consumer price sensitivity, with multiple reports of margin compression. In some instances, prices declined for certain materials due to sluggish demand, deferred tariff implementation, or reduced tariff rates, continuing a trend noted previously for steel and lumber. Looking ahead, contacts largely expect upward cost pressures to persist, but plans to raise selling prices in the near term were mixed, signaling greater hesitancy in passing on costs compared to the prior outlook.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Sector Themes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer activity:</strong> Spending declined further, reflecting a broad pullback by lower- and middle-income consumers, exacerbated by the government shutdown and the expiration of EV tax credits. Higher-end retail spending and luxury travel remained resilient, suggesting a continued bifurcation in consumer behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Activity increased somewhat, a positive shift from varied and challenging conditions previously. However, tariffs and related uncertainty continued to be a significant headwind, impacting input costs and export demand, despite some firms reporting increased demand related to AI data centers.</li>
  <li><strong>Services:</strong> The nonfinancial services sector remained flat to down, with business, information, leisure, and hospitality services seeing declines, and government shutdown impacts noted. Demand for specific professional services, like tax planning, and technology services related to data needs or AI adoption, showed some resilience.</li>
  <li><strong>Housing & construction:</strong> Residential real estate activity remained mixed, with sales declining in some areas (Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco, St. Louis) but showing renewed strength in others due to lower mortgage rates (Boston, Chicago). Commercial real estate activity also remained mixed but with signs of recovery in office markets in certain districts (New York, Boston), though construction generally continued to decline due to high costs and uncertain funding.</li>
  <li><strong>Banking & credit:</strong> Loan demand was mixed, with some districts (Cleveland) seeing increases driven by lower interest rates, while others (New York, Dallas) experienced overall declines. Consumer loan delinquencies continued to rise in several districts (St. Louis, Richmond, Dallas, New York), remaining elevated despite general improvements in credit quality, and credit standards continued to tighten for business loans.</li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture & energy:</strong> Conditions in these sectors were largely stable but still faced challenges. Agriculture struggled with low commodity prices, trade policy uncertainties, and adverse weather, with some districts reporting deteriorating farm finances. Energy activity saw moderate growth, particularly with strong demand for primary energy sources tied to data center development, offsetting some concerns about low oil prices.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Regional Dispersion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stronger districts:</strong> The <em>Boston</em> District expanded slightly, driven by strong gains in home sales and modest growth in manufacturing sales, with a cautiously optimistic outlook. <em>Chicago</em> reported a slight rise in activity across multiple sectors including consumer and business spending, manufacturing, and real estate, alongside loosened financial conditions. <em>Cleveland</em> also saw a slight increase in business activity, noting moderate growth in professional and business services and a boost to manufacturing from AI data centers.</li>
  <li><strong>Softer districts:</strong> <em>New York</em> experienced a modest decline, with falling employment, slight easing in price increases, and continued declines in the services sector. <em>Philadelphia</em> faced modest declines across most sectors, exacerbated by the government shutdown and falling employment. <em>Kansas City</em> slowed slightly with softer labor and cooling consumer activity. <em>Dallas</em> reported weakened activity in nonfinancial services, retail, and banking, alongside a weak housing market. <em>San Francisco</em> edged down slightly, particularly in retail, agriculture, and residential real estate. <em>St. Louis</em> activity was unchanged but with a perceived slowdown in demand amplified by the government shutdown, leading to a slightly pessimistic outlook.</li>
  <li><strong>Common constraints:</strong> Widespread concerns about tariffs driving up input costs and compressing margins, ongoing economic uncertainty affecting both consumer and business confidence, and labor market challenges including skilled worker shortages, reduced availability of immigrant workers, and rising health insurance costs. The recent federal government shutdown was a common disruptor, impacting consumer purchases and social services delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> The discernible impact of <em>AI technologies</em> on labor demand, leading to entry-level job displacement or reduced hiring needs in several districts. The immediate and negative effect of the <em>expiration of the federal EV tax credit</em> on auto sales in multiple districts. Robust demand for <em>data center construction</em> emerged as a notable driver of activity in specific manufacturing and energy segments across Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Signals to Watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth risks:</strong> The persistence of broad economic uncertainty and policy-related concerns, ongoing consumer caution and price sensitivity impacting discretionary spending, and the broader, lingering effects of the government shutdown on demand.</li>
  <li><strong>Labour inflections:</strong> The increasing reliance on attrition and hiring freezes over layoffs, further evidence of AI displacing entry-level roles, and the ongoing tension between skilled labor shortages and a general easing of worker availability.</li>
  <li><strong>Inflation persistence:</strong> Widespread and sticky input cost pressures, particularly from tariffs and rising service costs (insurance, healthcare), alongside firms' mixed ability and willingness to pass these costs through to consumers, signaling potential for continued margin compression.</li>
  <li><strong>Capital investment:</strong> Business hesitancy toward long-term capital investments amid uncertainty, contrasted with targeted investment in automation and the pronounced demand for data center construction projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial stress:</strong> Continued increases in consumer loan delinquencies, particularly among lower- and middle-income households, and ongoing tightening of credit standards by banks for business loans.</li>
