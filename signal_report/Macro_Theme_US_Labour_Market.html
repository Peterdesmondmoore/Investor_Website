  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><p><em>Employment composition, tightness, wages, hours, flows and sentiment.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The US labor market is currently characterised by a predominantly Neutral regime, exhibiting signs of cooling at the margin across several indicators. While headline metrics remain stable, underlying trends suggest a gradual increase in slack and a softening of demand-side pressures. This dynamic is observed alongside sustained bearish sentiment and turnover signals.</p>
<p>There is a divergence between some current regime classifications and their underlying z-scores, indicating proximity to regime shifts. Specifically, several "NEUTRAL" classified signals are trending towards or closely approaching "COOL" or "Bearish" thresholds.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Employment composition regime: NEUTRAL (approaching COOL)</li>
  <li>Underemployment trend and level: NEUTRAL (U-6 momentum rising)</li>
  <li>Tightness / turnover conditions: NEUTRAL / Bearish (easing tightness, sustained bearish turnover)</li>
  <li>Hours and momentum signals: NEUTRAL (hours z-score approaching COOL, momentum incomplete)</li>
  <li>Overall labour-market bias: Two-sided, with increasing downside risks from hidden slack and demand indicators.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Employment Composition &amp; Headline Slack</h3>
<p>The Employment Composition Signal is classified as NEUTRAL as of September 2025, with a z-score of -0.657. This position is close to the threshold for a 'COOL' regime, indicating potential for rising slack. The unemployment rate for September 2025 stood at 4.4%, reflecting an increase of 0.3 percentage points over three months.</p>
<p>The employment-population ratio's z-score is -0.771 and the negative unemployment rate z-score is -0.843, both indicating below-average performance relative to their historical distributions. These metrics collectively suggest a deteriorating underlying health in the labor market, despite the composite remaining technically in a neutral state.</p>

<h3>2. Underemployment &amp; Hidden Slack</h3>
<p>The Underemployment Risk signal is in a NEUTRAL regime as of September 2025, with a composite z-score of 0.519. However, the U-6 underutilization rate shows a z-score of 0.674 and positive 3-month momentum of +0.3, indicating an increase in broad labor market slack. The median weeks unemployed has a z-score of 0.365 and slightly negative 3-month momentum of -0.1.</p>
<p>While currently in the NEUTRAL band, the upward momentum in U-6 suggests a build-up of under-utilised labor. This easing in underlying stress, particularly from U-6 dynamics, implies a reduction in potential wage pressure and a possible softening in consumption support moving forward.</p>

<h3>3. Tightness, Turnover &amp; Job Flows</h3>
<p>Labor Market Tightness, as measured by JOLTS, is in a NEUTRAL regime as of August 2025, with a composite z-score of -0.371. The quits rate stands at 1.9% against a layoffs rate of 1.1%, resulting in a Labor Tightness differential of 0.8 percentage points. Both the Labor Tightness and Openings z-scores are below their historical medians, indicating easing demand-supply conditions.</p>
<p>The Labor Market Turnover Differential signal is Bearish as of August 2025, with a z-score of -0.843, reflecting a sustained period of low worker confidence. Job Flows & Labor Dynamism, a quarterly measure, registered a NEUTRAL regime in Q4 2024 with a composite z-score of -0.212. However, the smoothed composite z-score for job flows was -1.080, suggesting an underlying cool trend in labor market dynamism, with net job creation at 287.0 and a steadily declining 4-quarter moving average of labor dynamism to 154.00.</p>

<h3>4. Hours Worked &amp; Labour Momentum</h3>
<p>The Weekly Hours signal is in a NEUTRAL regime as of September 2025, with a composite z-score of -0.674. Both total private and manufacturing average weekly hours exhibit z-scores of -0.674, indicating levels below their historical medians and closely approaching the 'COOL' threshold. Manufacturing hours experienced a 3-month decline of -0.2 hours, suggesting firms are adjusting work schedules, potentially before implementing headcount reductions.</p>
<p>Labour Market Momentum is in a Neutral regime as of November 2025, with a composite index of 0.404. However, the payrolls component (Z_PAYEMS) is missing for the two latest months (October and November 2025), which significantly impacts the composite's interpretation. The Initial Claims component (Z_ICSA) indicates strong positive momentum at 0.73, suggesting a decline in jobless claims. Prior to the missing data, the PAYEMS 3-month difference z-score in September 2025 was -0.495, consistent with a softening in short-term payroll growth.</p>

<h3>5. Sectoral Breadth &amp; Diffusion</h3>
<p>The Sectoral Employment Diffusion Index is in a NEUTRAL regime as of September 2025, with a z-score of 0.0, indicating that the breadth of employment gains is at its rolling median. The index stands at 50.0, implying an equal split between sectors experiencing year-over-year employment growth and those experiencing contraction or stagnation. The median sector year-over-year growth is a modest 0.09%.</p>
<p>Leisure & Hospitality shows the strongest growth at 1.39% year-over-year, while Manufacturing exhibits a contraction of -0.73%. This suggests a divergence in performance, with services sectors maintaining some resilience while goods-producing sectors face headwinds, but overall breadth remains balanced rather than broadly expanding or contracting.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesised US Labour Market Regime</h3>
<p>The US labor market is in a nuanced state, best described as "Neutral with Emerging Slack and Demand Headwinds." While core employment composition, tightness, and weekly hours signals currently reside in a neutral classification, their underlying z-scores often sit below historical medians and are trending closer to cooling thresholds. This is corroborated by a persistent Bearish Labor Turnover signal and deeply Bearish consumer sentiment. Labor momentum shows mixed signals, partially due to data incompleteness, but declining initial claims suggest some resilience, while job flows indicate underlying weakness despite a neutral headline.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside / Resilience Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Stabilisation or improvement in underemployment metrics, particularly the median duration of unemployment.</li>
  <li>Sustained low initial jobless claims and a re-acceleration of payroll growth, improving labor market momentum.</li>
  <li>Sectoral re-acceleration and broadening of gains, particularly in interest-sensitive or cyclically exposed sectors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside / Slowdown Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Underemployment turning “HOT” or median duration of unemployment rising consistently.</li>
  <li>Further deterioration in job flows (net creation, dynamism) and persistent bearish turnover readings.</li>
  <li>Sectoral diffusion tipping into COOL with broad-based weakening across a wider array of industries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The current labor market configuration, characterized by neutral but cooling signals and persistent bearish sentiment, suggests a potential moderation in wage pressure. As slack gradually increases and labor demand softens, the impetus for strong wage growth may diminish. This condition aligns with a disinflationary impulse over the medium term, provided other inflation drivers remain contained.</p>
<p>For household consumption, the mixed signals present a two-sided risk: while employment remains generally neutral, increasing underemployment risk and bearish consumer sentiment could weigh on future spending decisions. Corporate earnings sensitivity to labor signals may shift from concern over labor shortages and rising wage costs to potential softness in demand and revenue growth, prompting further adjustments to hiring and hours. In a macro-policy context, the emerging signs of cooling could reduce the urgency for further restrictive measures, potentially shifting the focus towards monitoring the pace of deceleration and its impact on broader economic stability.</p></div></section>
