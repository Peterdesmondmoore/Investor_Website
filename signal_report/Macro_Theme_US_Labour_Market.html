  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><p><em>Employment composition, tightness, wages, hours, flows and sentiment.</em></p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The U.S. labor market is exhibiting a broad-based cooling trend, with many indicators shifting towards or residing within "NEUTRAL" regimes, albeit with a bias towards underlying softening conditions. While headline employment composition is "NEUTRAL" after exiting a "COOL" period, underlying metrics and forward-looking sentiment signals highlight increasing slack and reduced dynamism.</p>
<p>This evolving landscape presents a two-sided risk profile, with core tightness measures remaining neutral, yet worker confidence and some employment dynamics signaling further deterioration.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Employment composition regime:</strong> NEUTRAL, with a z-score nearing the "COOL" threshold, reflecting persistent slack.</li>
  <li><strong>Underemployment trend and level:</strong> NEUTRAL, though U-6 underutilization shows elevated stress and a rising 3-month trend.</li>
  <li><strong>Tightness / turnover conditions:</strong> JOLTS tightness is NEUTRAL, but the labor market turnover differential is in a "Bearish" regime, indicating significant loosening.</li>
  <li><strong>Hours and momentum signals:</strong> Weekly hours are NEUTRAL but the level z-score is approaching "COOL", while labor market momentum is NEUTRAL despite softening payroll growth components.</li>
  <li><strong>Overall labour-market bias:</strong> Characterized by a cooling trend with increasing underlying slack, particularly evident in worker confidence, job-finding durations, and decelerating hiring breadth.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Employment Composition &amp; Headline Slack</h3>
<p>As of September 2025, the Employment Composition Signal is in a NEUTRAL regime, with a composite z-score of -0.657, positioning it close to the "COOL" threshold. This follows two consecutive months in a "COOL (slack rising)" regime. The unemployment rate increased by 0.3 points over three months to 4.4%, with its inverted z-score at -0.843, indicating a relatively high level of unemployment.</p>
<p>The employment-population ratio's z-score stands at -0.771, signaling persistent weakness in this metric. These trends collectively reflect persistent underlying slack in the labor market, despite the return to a "NEUTRAL" headline classification.</p>

<h3>2. Underemployment &amp; Hidden Slack</h3>
<p>The Underemployment Risk Signal registered a NEUTRAL regime as of September 2025, with a composite z-score of 0.52. The U-6 underutilization rate is 8.0%, and its corresponding z-score is 0.67. This indicates elevated stress within the neutral range, representing a notable portion of underutilized labor capacity. The median weeks unemployed stood at 10.0, with its z-score at 0.36.</p>
<p>The U-6 underutilization rate increased by 0.3 points over the past three months, signaling a rise in broader underemployment. This points to moderate but increasing hidden slack within the labor market, potentially limiting future consumption support and contributing to eased wage pressure.</p>

<h3>3. Tightness, Turnover &amp; Job Flows</h3>
<p>The Labor Market Tightness Signal (JOLTS), as of October 2025, remains in a NEUTRAL regime with a composite z-score of -0.44. However, its internal Labor Tightness z-score (quits minus layoffs) is -0.74, nearing the "COOL" threshold, while the Job Openings z-score is 0.0.</p>
<p>The Labor Market Turnover Differential, also for October 2025, is in a "Bearish" regime, with a z-score of -1.18. This indicates a significant loosening of conditions and decreasing worker confidence, as the quits rate (1.8%) exceeds the layoff rate (1.2%) by a relatively narrow margin of 0.6 percentage points. Job Flows data, last updated for Q4 2024, showed a NEUTRAL regime with a composite z-score of -0.21, but with Net Job Creation at 287.0 and Labor Dynamism (4-quarter MA) at 154.00, reflecting a decline in overall dynamism. The "Bearish" turnover differential and weakening job flows suggest an overall cooling trend, despite the headline JOLTS tightness remaining in a neutral state.</p>

<h3>4. Hours Worked &amp; Labour Momentum</h3>
<p>The Weekly Hours Signal is in a NEUTRAL regime as of September 2025. The Hours Level Composite z-score is -0.67, closely approaching the "COOL" regime threshold of -0.75. Total Private Average Weekly Hours showed no change over three months, while Manufacturing Average Weekly Hours decreased by 0.2 hours over the same period, suggesting firms are adjusting margins via hours before headcount, particularly in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>Labour Market Momentum, as of September 2025, is also in a Neutral regime, with a composite z-score of -0.11. While the overall momentum remains within the neutral band, the payrolls (PAYEMS 3-month difference) component shows a softening trend with a z-score of -0.49. This is partially offset by declining initial jobless claims, which exhibit positive momentum. This indicates a mixed but generally decelerating short-term trend in hiring.</p>

<h3>5. Sectoral Breadth &amp; Diffusion</h3>
<p>As of September 2025, the Sectoral Employment Diffusion Signal is in a NEUTRAL regime, with a Diffusion Index of 50.0 and a z-score of 0.0. This indicates that half of the tracked sectors are experiencing positive year-over-year employment growth. The median sector year-over-year growth is marginally positive at 0.09%.</p>
<p>However, sectoral performance shows divergence; Manufacturing employment contracted by -0.73% year-over-year, and Professional & Business Services declined by -0.27% year-over-year. Conversely, Leisure & Hospitality demonstrated the strongest growth at 1.39% year-over-year. This suggests that while overall breadth remains neutral, slack is becoming more concentrated in specific sectors, indicating a fragile and uneven labor market expansion.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesised US Labour Market Regime</h3>
<p>The synthesised U.S. labor market regime is best characterized as "Cooling at the Margin with Increasing Hidden Slack". While a majority of headline indicators remain in a "NEUTRAL" regime, several underlying components and forward-looking sentiment signals point to a clear softening trend. This is reflected in employment composition nearing the "COOL" threshold, rising underemployment stress, bearish labor market turnover, and decelerating payroll momentum. Divergences across sectors further underscore the uneven nature of the current labor dynamics. This composite view indicates a rebalancing market, not yet in a severe "COOL" phase but consistently shedding tightness from its recent peak.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside / Resilience Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Stabilisation or improvement in underemployment metrics, particularly U-6 and median duration.</li>
  <li>Improving turnover dynamics marked by a rebound in worker-initiated quits relative to layoffs.</li>
  <li>Sectoral re-acceleration and broadening of employment gains beyond services, encompassing goods-producing sectors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside / Slowdown Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Underemployment turning "HOT" or a sustained increase in unemployment duration.</li>
  <li>Further deterioration in job flows, with net job creation turning consistently negative and dynamism declining.</li>
  <li>Sectoral diffusion tipping into a "COOL" regime with broad-based weakening across most industries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The observed cooling trend in the labor market, characterized by increasing hidden slack and weakening turnover, implies an easing of wage pressure. The Wage Pressure z-score, part of the Wage Growth and Inflation Signal, stands at -0.71 (NEUTRAL but negative), consistent with this rebalancing of labor demand and supply. A sustained period of such conditions typically supports disinflationary narratives.</p>
<p>The combination of increasing slack and "Bearish" consumer sentiment (UMCSENT Level_z at -1.02) suggests potential headwinds for household consumption. This may translate to lower corporate earnings growth as labor costs moderate but consumer demand softens. From a macro-policy perspective, this regime indicates that past monetary tightening is effectively rebalancing the labor market, potentially reducing pressure for further restrictive policy actions, and could inform considerations for future policy adjustments toward a less restrictive stance.</p></div></section>
