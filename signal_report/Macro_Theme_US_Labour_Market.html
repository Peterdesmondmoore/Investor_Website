  <section class="section"><h2 class="section-title">Gemini Summary</h2><div class="box summary-box market-report"><h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The US labour market currently presents a mixed but predominantly normalising picture, characterized by easing tightness in some areas alongside persistent demand headwinds and softening sentiment in others. Several aggregate indicators, including employment composition, underemployment risk, and labour market tightness (JOLTS), are classified as 'NEUTRAL'. However, the labour market turnover differential and consumer sentiment signals are 'Bearish', suggesting underlying weakness and caution among workers and consumers. Wage and hours dynamics reflect moderation, with weekly hours in a 'NEUTRAL' state and the wage growth composite indicating moderating inflation risk.</p>
<p>While traditional measures of tightness and slack indicate a rebalancing from historically tight conditions, forward-looking sentiment and worker confidence signals suggest a more pronounced softening trend. The overall labour regime reflects a period of adjustment, where capacity constraints appear to be easing without yet translating into broad-based aggregate slack across all metrics. The divergence between backward-looking aggregate measures and forward-looking sentiment/flow data warrants close monitoring for further indications of market inflection points.</p>

<h2>Aggregate Labour Market Conditions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Employment Breadth and Composition:</strong> The Employment Composition signal is currently 'NEUTRAL' as of September 2025, with a smoothed composite z-score of -0.693, following a brief 'COOL' phase in July-August 2025. The unemployment rate increased to 4.4% in September 2025, with 3-month momentum for unemployment at +0.3. Sectoral Employment Diffusion is also 'NEUTRAL' as of September 2025, with 50.0% of sectors showing positive year-over-year growth, but median sector growth is a modest 0.09%.</li>
  <li><strong>Labour Market Tightness:</strong> The Labor Market Tightness (JOLTS) signal is 'NEUTRAL' as of August 2025, with a smoothed composite z-score of -0.297. The quits rate stands at 1.9%, layoffs at 1.1%, and job openings at 4.3%. The Labor Market Turnover Differential is 'Bearish' as of August 2025, with a z-score of -0.843, reflecting a negative shift in worker confidence relative to employer-initiated separations.</li>
  <li><strong>Underemployment and Slack:</strong> The Underemployment Risk signal is 'NEUTRAL' as of September 2025, with a smoothed composite z-score of 0.535. The U-6 underutilization rate is 8.0%, and median weeks unemployed is 10.0 weeks. Momentum for U-6 is positive (+0.3), suggesting a slight increase in underutilization.</li>
  <li><strong>Job Flows and Turnover:</strong> The Job Flows & Labor Dynamism signal is 'NEUTRAL' as of Q4 2024, although its smoothed composite z-score of -1.080 indicates a level that would typically be classified as 'COOL' by methodology thresholds. Net job creation was 287k in Q4 2024, with the 4-quarter moving average of dynamism at 154.00, continuing a declining trend from earlier periods. The Labour Market Momentum signal is 'Neutral' as of November 2025, with ICSA YoY down 4.0% but CCSA YoY up 4.6%, and PAYEMS 3-month difference at 187k in September 2025.</li>
  <li><strong>Wage Growth and Hours Worked:</strong> The Weekly Hours signal is 'NEUTRAL' as of September 2025, with total private hours stable at 34.2 and manufacturing hours declining by 0.2 over three months to 39.9. The Wage Growth and Inflation Composite is 'NEUTRAL' as of August 2025, with a smoothed composite z-score of -0.526, and a Wage Pressure z-score of -0.705.</li>
  <li><strong>Consumer Sentiment (as a Demand Proxy):</strong> University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment is 'Bearish' as of October 2025, with a level of 53.6 and a robust z-score of -1.018, indicating a significant and sustained deterioration in consumer confidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current labour regime indicates a period of normalization and softening, with aggregate measures mostly 'NEUTRAL' but forward-looking indicators and specific flow dynamics exhibiting 'Bearish' or 'COOL' characteristics.</p>

<h2>Employment Composition and Sectoral Breadth</h2>
<p>The Employment Composition (CPS) signal is in a 'NEUTRAL' regime as of September 2025, reflecting a recovery from 'COOL (slack rising)' readings in July and August 2025. The unemployment rate has risen from 4.1% in October 2024 to 4.4% in September 2025, indicating an ongoing loosening of the aggregate labour market.</p>
<p>Sectoral Employment Diffusion (CES) is also 'NEUTRAL' as of September 2025, with a diffusion index of 50.0. This indicates an equal split between sectors experiencing year-over-year employment growth and those experiencing contraction. Specifically, growth is observed in Leisure & Hospitality (1.39% YoY) and Construction (0.46% YoY), while Manufacturing (-0.73% YoY) and Professional & Business Services (-0.27% YoY) show contraction. This mixed sectoral performance suggests cyclical shifts in employment, with some sectors decelerating while others maintain growth.</p>

<h2>Labour Market Tightness and Underemployment</h2>
<p>The Labor Market Tightness (JOLTS) signal is classified as 'NEUTRAL' as of August 2025. The smoothed composite z-score of -0.297 indicates that the balance between demand and supply in the labour market is neither exceptionally tight nor significantly loose. The quits rate stands at 1.9%, the layoffs rate at 1.1%, and the job openings rate at 4.3%. These levels suggest an easing from peak tightness observed in earlier periods.</p>
<p>Underemployment Risk (CPS) is also in a 'NEUTRAL' regime as of September 2025, with its smoothed composite z-score at 0.535. The U-6 underutilization rate of 8.0% and median weeks unemployed at 10.0 weeks suggest that while there is some underutilization and friction in job finding, it does not currently represent a highly stressed state. The configuration suggests easing capacity constraints from a tightness perspective, with residual slack not yet indicating an acute imbalance.</p>

<h2>Job Flows, Turnover and Dynamism</h2>
<p>Job Flows & Labor Dynamism (BDS) is in a 'NEUTRAL' regime as of Q4 2024. Net Job Creation for the quarter was 287k, contributing to a Labor Dynamism 4-Quarter Moving Average of 154.00, which reflects a continued deceleration in firm-level dynamism from higher levels in early 2022. The smoothed composite z-score for job flows, at -1.080, indicates a level of dynamism below historical median, despite the official 'NEUTRAL' regime classification.</p>
<p>The Labor Market Turnover Differential, which tracks worker-initiated quits versus employer-initiated layoffs, is in a 'Bearish' regime as of August 2025. The differential is 0.8 percentage points (quits rate 1.9%, layoffs rate 1.1%), with a robust z-score of -0.843. This 'Bearish' classification, persistent since late 2023 / early 2024, suggests a decline in worker confidence and a shift towards more stressed labour reallocation dynamics rather than an orderly one.</p>
<p>Labour Market Momentum (FRED) is in a 'Neutral' regime as of November 2025. While Initial Claims (ICSA) year-on-year declined by 4.0%, Continuing Claims (CCSA) year-on-year rose by 4.6%, indicating mixed signals in claims data. Nonfarm payrolls (PAYEMS) showed a 3-month difference of 187k in September 2025, contributing to a negative Z-score for payrolls momentum.</p>

<h2>Wages, Hours and Inflation Linkages</h2>
<p>The Weekly Hours (CES) signal is in a 'NEUTRAL' regime as of September 2025. Total Private average weekly hours remained stable at 34.2, while Manufacturing average weekly hours saw a 3-month decline of 0.2 to 39.9. The smoothed composite z-score for weekly hours is -0.321, indicating that labor demand, as proxied by hours worked, is balanced rather than showing significant expansion or contraction.</p>
<p>The Wage Growth and Inflation Composite signal is in a 'NEUTRAL' regime as of August 2025, with a smoothed composite z-score of -0.526. The Wage Pressure z-score, a component of this composite, stands at -0.705. This suggests moderating wage-driven inflation risk, consistent with the observed neutral hours dynamics and negative wage pressure momentum.</p>

<h2>Sentiment and Demand Signals</h2>
<p>University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment (UMCSENT) is in a 'Bearish' regime as of October 2025, with the index level at 53.6 and its robust z-score at -1.018. This indicates a significantly low level of consumer confidence relative to historical norms, with notable year-over-year (-23.97%) and 3-month (-13.13%) declines.</p>
<p>This 'Bearish' sentiment among consumers largely contradicts the 'NEUTRAL' readings from many core labour market indicators such as employment composition, labour market tightness, and underemployment risk. The divergence suggests that while aggregate employment data may not yet show widespread slack, the demand-side impulse from consumers is weak and could foreshadow future softening in labour outcomes.</p>

<h2>Cross-Signal Synthesis</h2>
<p>Reinforcing relationships are observed between the 'Bearish' University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment and the 'Bearish' Labor Market Turnover Differential, both pointing to declining worker confidence and potential demand headwinds. This is further supported by the decelerating trend in Job Flows and Labor Dynamism, and mixed but generally easing momentum in Labour Market Momentum components. The overall 'NEUTRAL' classification across several aggregate labour indicators (Employment Composition, Underemployment Risk, Labor Market Tightness, Weekly Hours, Wage Growth and Inflation Composite) suggests a broad stabilization or normalization rather than strong, broad-based expansion.</p>
<p>Conflicts or asymmetries are evident in the contrast between the deeply 'Bearish' consumer sentiment and turnover signals, and the 'NEUTRAL' regimes of traditional labour market tightness and underemployment measures. This indicates that while the current state of labour supply and demand may appear balanced by certain metrics, underlying psychological and flow dynamics suggest a forward-looking deterioration not yet fully reflected in concurrent aggregate data.</p>
<p>The observed shifts, such as the transition from 'COOL' to 'NEUTRAL' in Employment Composition and Labor Market Tightness, suggest a cyclical adjustment from post-pandemic tightness. However, the persistent 'Bearish' signals from sentiment and turnover, coupled with negative year-over-year growth in key employment sectors, may indicate a more entrenched cyclical slowdown rather than merely a return to equilibrium.</p>
<p>The overall configuration suggests softening labour conditions, characterized by easing tightness from a cyclical peak, emerging slack in worker confidence and turnover, but still relatively balanced aggregate employment and hours. This indicates a market in transition, with downside momentum in sentiment and specific flow data contrasting with more stable aggregate indicators.</p>

<h2>Watchpoints (Forward-Looking Conditions)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A sustained decline in the quits rate coupled with a corresponding rise in the layoffs rate, pushing the Labor Market Turnover Differential further into a 'Bearish' regime.</li>
  <li>An acceleration of the aggregate unemployment rate beyond 4.5% or a sustained shift of the Employment Composition signal into a 'COOL' regime.</li>
  <li>Broadening of negative year-over-year employment growth across a majority of sectors, causing the Sectoral Employment Diffusion index to drop below 50% and enter a 'COOL' regime.</li>
  <li>A deterioration of average weekly hours in total private and manufacturing sectors, leading to the Weekly Hours signal moving into a 'COOL' regime.</li>
  <li>A reacceleration of continuing jobless claims year-on-year, accompanied by sustained negative 3-month payroll momentum, shifting the Labour Market Momentum signal into a 'Softening' regime.</li>
  <li>University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment remaining deeply 'Bearish' or declining further, with an accelerating negative year-over-year change.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The labour market is undergoing a period of normalization, marked by a gradual easing of tightness from previous elevated levels. While many aggregate indicators of tightness and underemployment are currently categorized as 'NEUTRAL', a notable and persistent 'Bearish' signal from worker turnover and deeply negative consumer sentiment readings suggest the presence of emerging slack and demand headwinds. Wage and hours dynamics reflect a moderating trend, with wage pressure indicators consistent with contained, rather than accelerating, inflationary risks. The characteristics of current conditions appear predominantly cyclical, indicating a rebalancing following a period of post-pandemic expansion. However, the depth and persistence of negative sentiment and turnover signals warrant careful observation, as they may suggest a more enduring cyclical softening not yet fully captured by all aggregate employment measures.</p>

<h2>Model and Signal Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Integration of a broader measure of real wage growth, such as Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) adjusted for CPI or PCE, to better assess purchasing power and its impact on consumer demand.</li>
  <li>Inclusion of real-time job vacancy data from alternative sources (e.g., private job boards) to complement JOLTS and provide a higher-frequency perspective on labour demand-supply imbalance.</li>
  <li>Incorporation of small business sentiment regarding hiring plans and compensation from surveys (e.g., NFIB Small Business Optimism Index employment components) for a forward-looking perspective on private sector employment.</li>
  <li>Disaggregation of wage growth trends by key demographic or skill cohorts to identify more granular pockets of persistent tightness or emerging slack.</li>
  <li>Monitoring of detailed labour force flows data (e.g., transitions from employment to unemployment or out of the labour force) for a more granular understanding of labour market dynamism and scarring effects.</li>
  <li>Periodic recalibration and backtesting of regime thresholds for all composite signals to ensure robustness across different economic cycles and market conditions.</li>
