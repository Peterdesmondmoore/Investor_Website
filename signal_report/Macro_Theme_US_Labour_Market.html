<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The US labor market currently exhibits characteristics of a cooling phase, with an underlying bias towards increasing slack despite several composite signals maintaining a "NEUTRAL" regime. While headline unemployment rates remain relatively contained, deeper indicators suggest a loosening trend in labor demand and worker confidence. Significant downside risks stem from deteriorating turnover and potential broadening of employment weakness, while upside risks are limited to a potential re-acceleration in specific, currently strong sectors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Employment composition remains NEUTRAL, but with signals of persistent underlying slack.</li>
  <li>Underemployment indicators are NEUTRAL, yet overall stress remains historically high with some signs of increasing slack momentum.</li>
  <li>Labor market tightness, as measured by JOLTS, is NEUTRAL but shows easing conditions, particularly in the quits-layoffs differential. Turnover, however, is Bearish.</li>
  <li>Weekly hours are NEUTRAL with flat to negative momentum, and overall labor momentum is Neutral, although with mixed underlying signals like flattening payrolls.</li>
  <li>Sectoral breadth is NEUTRAL with an equal balance of expanding and contracting sectors, masking a declining median growth rate.</li>
  <li>Overall labor-market bias is seen as still cooling at the margin, with underlying slack risks outweighing signs of resilience.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Employment Composition &amp; Headline Slack</h3>
<p>The Employment Composition signal currently registers a NEUTRAL regime as of September 2025. The unemployment rate stood at 4.4%, with the participation rate at 62.4% and the employment-population ratio at 59.7% <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Employment_Composition_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: employment_composition.html]</a>. Despite the nominal NEUTRAL classification, the negative z-score for unemployment (which inversely reflects slack) was -0.843113 in September 2025, indicating persistent relative slack in the labor market <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Employment_Composition_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: employment_composition.html]</a>. This suggests that while headline metrics prevent a "COOL" classification, the underlying health points to increasing availability of labor.</p>

<h3>2. Underemployment &amp; Hidden Slack</h3>
<p>The Underemployment Risk signal is classified as NEUTRAL as of September 2025, with a composite z-score of 0.519540 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Underemployment_Risk_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: underemployment_risk]</a>. This composite is derived from the U-6 underutilization rate, which was 8.0%, and median weeks unemployed, at 10.0 weeks <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Underemployment_Risk_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: underemployment_risk]</a>. Critically, despite the NEUTRAL regime, the signal's 0-100 score is 99.999999, indicating that underemployment stress remains near its observed historical maximum <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Underemployment_Risk_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: underemployment_risk]</a>. Furthermore, the 3-month momentum for U-6 underutilization is +0.3, suggesting a recent increase in broad labor market slack. This extended period of high underemployment could weigh on future consumption and mitigate wage pressure.</p>

<h3>3. Tightness, Turnover &amp; Job Flows</h3>
<p>Labor market tightness, as indicated by the JOLTS-derived signal, is in a NEUTRAL regime through October 2025, with the LMT Composite z-score at -0.441485 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labor_Market_Tightness_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: labor_market_tightness]</a>. However, the underlying Labor Tightness z-score (reflecting the quits-layoffs differential) has eased to -0.735808, nearing the "COOL" regime threshold <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labor_Market_Tightness_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: labor_market_tightness]</a>. The quits rate stands at 1.8% while the layoffs rate is 1.2% in October 2025, contributing to a Turnover Differential of 0.6 percentage points <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labor_Market_Turnover.html" target="_blank">[Source: Labor_Market_Turnover.html]</a>.</p>
<p>Labor market turnover, specifically the differential between quits and layoffs, has been in a "Bearish" regime since February 2025, with a Turnover Differential z-score of -1.180359 in October 2025 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labor_Market_Turnover.html" target="_blank">[Source: Labor_Market_Turnover.html]</a>. This consistent "Bearish" reading suggests diminishing worker confidence and easing labor market frictions. Meanwhile, Job Flows, measured quarterly, were in a NEUTRAL regime as of Q4 2024, with a composite z-score of -0.211883 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Job_Flows_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: job_flows_labor]</a>. Net job creation was 287.0 in Q4 2024, but the 4-quarter moving average of dynamism has declined to 154.00, indicating waning churn and dynamism in the labor market over the longer term <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Job_Flows_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: job_flows_labor]</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Hours Worked &amp; Labour Momentum</h3>
<p>The Weekly Hours signal remains in a NEUTRAL regime through September 2025, with its composite z-score at -0.6744908 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Weekly_Hours.html" target="_blank">[Source: weekly_hours.html]</a>. Total private average weekly hours showed a 0.0% 3-month change in September 2025, while manufacturing hours recorded a -0.2% 3-month change <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Weekly_Hours.html" target="_blank">[Source: weekly_hours.html]</a>. These modest movements suggest firms are making minimal adjustments to working hours, which can precede headcount changes but currently reflects stable, non-extreme labor demand conditions.</p>
<p>Labour Market Momentum registered a Neutral regime as of December 2025, with a composite score of 0.034602 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labour_Market_Momentum.html" target="_blank">[Source: labour_market_momentum.html]</a>. This composite blends initial and continuing jobless claims with nonfarm payroll momentum. While initial claims showed a negative z-score (-0.476927), suggesting some increase, continuing claims registered a positive z-score (0.546132), indicating strength <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labour_Market_Momentum.html" target="_blank">[Source: labour_market_momentum.html]</a>. However, the z-score for the 3-month difference in nonfarm payrolls, as of September 2025, was -0.495187, signaling flattening payroll growth <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labour_Market_Momentum.html" target="_blank">[Source: labour_market_momentum.html]</a>. This indicates a mixed picture, where overall momentum is balanced but with signs of softening in key components.</p>

<h3>5. Sectoral Breadth &amp; Diffusion</h3>
<p>The Sectoral Employment Diffusion signal is in a NEUTRAL regime through September 2025, with its z-score consistently at 0.0 <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Sectoral_Employment_Diffusion_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: sectoral_employment]</a>. The Diffusion Index consistently registered 50.0, which indicates an equal number of sectors with positive and negative year-over-year employment growth <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Sectoral_Employment_Diffusion_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: sectoral_employment]</a>. While construction and leisure &amp; hospitality showed positive year-over-year growth, manufacturing and professional &amp; business services exhibited negative growth <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Sectoral_Employment_Diffusion_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: sectoral_employment]</a>. The median sector year-over-year growth has declined to 0.000925, suggesting that even within the "NEUTRAL" breadth, the underlying momentum is weakening and overall strength is not broadly based.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesised US Labour Market Regime</h3>
<p>The overall US labor market regime can be characterized as <strong>Cooling with Persistent Underlying Slack</strong>. While many headline composite signals (Employment Composition, Underemployment Risk, Labor Market Tightness, Weekly Hours, Labor Momentum, and Sectoral Diffusion) currently reside in a "NEUTRAL" regime, a deeper examination reveals consistent signs of easing demand, reduced worker confidence, and rising slack. The "Bearish" regime in Labor Market Turnover and the historically high levels of underemployment, alongside flattening payroll momentum and declining median sectoral growth, indicate a labor market that is decelerating from prior tightness, with potential downside risks accumulating. There are notable internal contradictions, with headline composite "NEUTRAL" classifications often masking underlying components that are nearing or entering "COOL" or "Bearish" territory.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside / Resilience Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Stabilisation or improvement in underemployment metrics, particularly U-6 and median duration, leading to reduced hidden slack.</li>
  <li>Improving turnover and job flows (stronger quits, robust hiring), signaling renewed worker confidence and firm dynamism.</li>
  <li>Sectoral re-acceleration and broadening of gains beyond currently strong sectors, with manufacturing or professional services showing sustained positive YoY growth.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside / Slowdown Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Underemployment turning “HOT” or median duration of unemployment rising materially, indicating deeper and more persistent labor market scarring.</li>
  <li>Further deterioration in job flows and hiring, with net job creation turning consistently negative and dynamism waning across more firms.</li>
  <li>Sectoral diffusion tipping into COOL with broad-based weakening across a wider array of industries, indicating a widespread deceleration in employment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The prevailing "Cooling with Persistent Underlying Slack" regime implies easing wage pressure, which could influence monetary policy considerations. While the Wage Growth and Inflation Composite is currently NEUTRAL <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal.html" target="_blank">[Source: wage_growth_and_inflation.html]</a>, the general trend toward increasing slack suggests a diminished risk of demand-driven inflation from the labor market. This environment typically lessens the impetus for aggressive monetary tightening.</p>
<p>The softening labor market signals, including bearish consumer sentiment <a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Consumer_Sentiment.html" target="_blank">[Source: Consumer_Sentiment.html]</a>, imply potential headwinds for household consumption, which is a key driver of economic growth. Corporate earnings sensitivity to labor signals may increase, particularly for sectors facing higher labor costs or those heavily reliant on robust consumer demand. Policymakers may interpret this composite regime as indicative of a labor market gradually moving towards a better balance, although the extent of "hidden slack" and sustained underemployment will be critical for assessing the appropriate policy stance.</p>
