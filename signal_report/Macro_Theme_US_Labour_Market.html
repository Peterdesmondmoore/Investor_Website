<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The U.S. labour market is exhibiting a cooling trend, shifting from prior tightness towards increasing slack across several key indicators. While many composite signals currently reside in a 'NEUTRAL' regime, underlying metrics and momentum diagnostics suggest a weakening bias. This is particularly evident in underemployment and consumer sentiment, which signal heightened stress and demand headwinds.</p>
<p>Labor turnover has moved into a Bearish regime, further indicating a reduction in worker confidence and market fluidity. Overall, the market is positioned to move further into a cooling phase, with risks tilted towards continued softening.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Employment Composition:</strong> NEUTRAL, with a trend towards increasing slack.</li>
  <li><strong>Underemployment:</strong> NEUTRAL, yet composite stress is near historical highs, driven by rising U-6 momentum.</li>
  <li><strong>Tightness / Turnover:</strong> Labor Market Tightness is NEUTRAL with easing conditions, while Labor Market Turnover is BEARISH, reflecting declining worker confidence.</li>
  <li><strong>Hours and Momentum:</strong> Both Weekly Hours and Labour Market Momentum are NEUTRAL, although weekly hours are approaching a cooling threshold.</li>
  <li><strong>Job Flows:</strong> NEUTRAL, showing an improvement from a 'COOL' regime, primarily due to reduced job losses rather than strong gains.</li>
  <li><strong>Sectoral Breadth:</strong> NEUTRAL, with stable breadth but weakening underlying median growth.</li>
  <li><strong>Consumer Sentiment:</strong> BEARISH, indicating persistent demand headwinds.</li>
  <li><strong>Overall Labour-Market Bias:</strong> Neutral with a notable weakening bias and rising slack.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Employment Composition &amp; Headline Slack</h3>
<p>The Employment Composition signal is currently in a NEUTRAL regime, with a z-score of -0.657 as of September 2025. This position is just above the 'COOL' threshold, reflecting a discernible trend towards increasing slack in the labour market. The unemployment rate stands at 4.4%, and the participation rate is 62.4%.</p>
<p>The employment-population ratio and unemployment rate components show the most significant deviation from their historical medians, with z-scores of -0.771 and -0.843 respectively. This indicates that these factors are contributing most to the observed slack, and the 3-month momentum in the unemployment rate (+0.3) suggests this trend may continue.</p>

<h3>2. Underemployment &amp; Hidden Slack</h3>
<p>The Underemployment Risk signal is in a NEUTRAL regime as of September 2025, with a composite z-score of 0.519540. Despite the 'NEUTRAL' classification, the signal's 0-100 score is 99.999999, indicating that current underemployment stress levels are near historical highs within the observed range.</p>
<p>Both the U-6 underutilization rate (8.0%) and the median weeks unemployed (10.0) are above their historical medians. The 3-month momentum for U-6 underutilization is +0.3, signaling an increasing trend in broader labour market slack and potentially sustained pressure on consumption and wage growth.</p>

<h3>3. Tightness, Turnover &amp; Job Flows</h3>
<p>Labor Market Tightness, as measured by the JOLTS composite, is in a NEUTRAL regime as of August 2025, with a z-score of -0.37. While neutral, this indicates an easing of tightness. The quits rate is 1.9%, layoffs rate 1.1%, and job openings rate 4.3%. Both the quits-layoffs differential and the openings rate components are below their rolling medians, with 3-month momentum diagnostics also indicating softening conditions.</p>
<p>Labor Market Turnover is currently in a BEARISH regime as of August 2025. The turnover differential (quits rate minus layoffs rate) is 0.8 percentage points, and its robust z-score is -0.84. This signals a significant decline in worker confidence and mobility, moving away from conditions that typically support wage pressure. Concurrently, the Job Flows signal is in a NEUTRAL regime for Q4 2024, improving from prior 'COOL' readings. This improvement is primarily driven by reduced job losses (positive z-score for negated losses), rather than robust gross job gains, which remain below their historical median.</p>

<h3>4. Hours Worked &amp; Labour Momentum</h3>
<p>The Weekly Hours signal is in a NEUTRAL regime as of September 2025, with a composite z-score of -0.674. This position is notably close to the 'COOL' regime threshold, indicating a stretched low level of average weekly hours. Both Total Private (34.2 hours) and Manufacturing (39.9 hours) components contribute to this below-median condition, suggesting softening labour demand from employers.</p>
<p>The Labour Market Momentum signal registered -0.11 for September 2025, remaining within a NEUTRAL regime. This indicates stable labour dynamics, with no extreme positioning in initial or continuing jobless claims. However, the payroll momentum component is the most negative contributor to the composite at -0.495, suggesting a flattening trend in short-term employment growth.</p>

<h3>5. Sectoral Breadth &amp; Diffusion</h3>
<p>The Sectoral Employment Diffusion signal is in a NEUTRAL regime as of September 2025, with a diffusion index of 50.0. This indicates that two out of the four tracked sectors (Manufacturing, Construction, Professional &amp; Business Services, Leisure &amp; Hospitality) are currently experiencing positive year-over-year employment growth. Leisure &amp; Hospitality exhibits the strongest growth (+1.39% YoY), while Manufacturing shows a decline (-0.73% YoY).</p>
<p>Despite the neutral diffusion index, the 3-month momentum for median sector year-over-year growth is negative. This suggests an underlying weakening in the broad-based expansion of employment, with growth becoming more concentrated and the overall breadth of job creation gradually narrowing.</p>

<h3>6. Synthesised US Labour Market Regime</h3>
<p>The synthesised US Labour Market Regime is broadly Neutral with a weakening bias. While headline metrics like Labour Market Momentum and Sectoral Diffusion remain in a neutral state, key forward-looking indicators and measures of hidden slack suggest an easing of tightness. Specifically, underemployment signals are elevated, and consumer sentiment is decisively bearish. Labor turnover has shifted to a bearish posture, and core employment composition is trending towards increased slack.</p>

<h3>7. Forward Risks</h3>

<h4>Upside / Resilience Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Stabilisation in underemployment</li>
  <li>Improving turnover and flows</li>
  <li>Sectoral re-acceleration</li>
</ul>

<h4>Downside / Slowdown Risks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Underemployment turning “HOT”</li>
  <li>Further deterioration in job flows</li>
  <li>Diffusion tipping into COOL</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Investment Interpretation (Informational)</h3>
<p>The observed cooling trend in the U.S. labour market, evidenced by easing tightness and rising hidden slack, implies a reduced upward pressure on wages. This environment is typically consistent with disinflationary forces. The bearish signals from consumer sentiment and labour turnover suggest potential headwinds for discretionary consumption and corporate earnings, as household confidence wanes and job security perceptions may shift.</p>
<p>From a policy perspective, the accumulation of slack and weakening momentum could allow for a less restrictive monetary policy stance. The mixed signals warrant close monitoring for a potential shift into a more decisively 'COOL' or 'BEARISH' regime across a broader set of indicators, which would have implications for growth and inflation outlooks.</p></div></section>
