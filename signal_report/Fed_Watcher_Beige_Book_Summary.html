<p><em>Descriptive synthesis of current US economic conditions based on district-level reporting.</em></p>
<hr>

<h3>National Backdrop</h3>
<p>
Economic activity was largely unchanged across the twelve Federal Reserve Districts, with a few noting modest declines and one reporting modest growth <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Consumer spending broadly declined, though higher-end retail remained resilient, with impacts observed from the government shutdown and the expiration of electric vehicle tax credits. Manufacturing activity increased somewhat, but tariffs and related uncertainty continued to pose headwinds. Revenues in nonfinancial services were mostly flat to down, and loan demand was mixed across districts. Outlooks were largely unchanged, with some contacts expressing increased risk of slower activity in the coming months, while manufacturers showed some optimism <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Labour Market Conditions</h3>
<p>
Employment declined slightly, with approximately half of the Districts noting weaker labor demand and an uptick in layoff announcements, though many firms opted for hiring freezes, attrition, or replacement-only hiring over outright layoffs <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Employers generally found it easier to find workers, despite persistent difficulty filling certain skilled positions and a scarcity of immigrant workers, as noted in Boston and St. Louis <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Wage growth was modest overall, with some sectors like manufacturing and health care experiencing more moderate wage pressure due to tighter supply <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Rising health insurance premiums continued to add upward pressure to labor costs across multiple regions. Artificial intelligence was noted by some firms, including in Cleveland and Philadelphia, as replacing entry-level positions or boosting productivity enough to curb new hiring <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Prices & Cost Pressures</h3>
<p>
Prices rose moderately during the reporting period, with input cost pressures remaining widespread, particularly in manufacturing and retail, often attributed to tariffs <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Districts like New York and Philadelphia reported strong input price increases from electricity, insurance, health care, and energy. The ability to pass through these higher costs to customers varied significantly by district and sector, depending on demand, competitive pressures, and consumer price sensitivity <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Multiple Districts, including Boston and Dallas, noted margin compression or financial strain for firms facing tariff-related costs. While prices for certain materials declined due to sluggish demand, contacts largely anticipate upward cost pressures to persist in the coming months, though plans for near-term price increases were mixed <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.
</p>

<h3>Sector Themes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer activity:</strong> Consumer spending declined further overall, influenced by cautious discretionary spending and federal policy changes like the EV tax credit expiration. Higher-end retail remained resilient, as seen in New York and Atlanta, but low- and middle-income consumers in districts like Philadelphia and Minneapolis showed increasing price sensitivity and financial strain <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Manufacturing activity increased somewhat overall, though districts like Richmond and Philadelphia reported modest declines. Strong demand was noted in certain segments like AI data center construction (Cleveland) and durable goods (Kansas City, Dallas), but tariffs continued to be a significant headwind impacting planning and competitiveness <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Services:</strong> Revenues in nonfinancial services were mostly flat to down, with particularly steep declines in business services, information, and leisure and hospitality in New York. However, professional and business services saw moderate growth in Cleveland due to tax law changes and AI adoption <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Housing & construction:</strong> Residential real estate activity eased slightly in several districts, with demand hindered by high mortgage rates (Cleveland) and sales not meeting expectations (St. Louis). Commercial real estate conditions improved marginally in some areas like New York and Atlanta due to office market recovery and data center construction, but construction activity broadly declined or slowed <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Banking & credit:</strong> Loan demand was mixed, with some districts like New York seeing overall declines except for residential mortgages. Credit standards were mostly unchanged but tightened for business loans and commercial mortgages in New York and Philadelphia. Delinquencies rose among households and small businesses in Philadelphia and St. Louis, with bankers expecting this trend to continue <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture & energy:</strong> Conditions were largely stable but challenged. Agriculture remained weak in Minneapolis and Dallas due to low crop prices, drought, and increased costs, despite strong harvests. Energy activity grew moderately in Atlanta, driven by data center demand, but oil and gas activity fell slightly in Kansas City due to low oil prices and a global supply surplus <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Regional Dispersion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stronger districts:</strong> <em>Chicago</em> reported slight economic growth with increases in employment, consumer spending, business spending, and manufacturing <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. <em>Boston</em> experienced slight expansion, boosted by renewed strength in home sales and strong revenue growth in parts of manufacturing and services <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Softer districts:</strong> <em>New York</em> and <em>Philadelphia</em> noted modest declines in economic activity, with the latter further impacted by the government shutdown <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. <em>Dallas</em> also weakened slightly, seeing declines across nonfinancial services, retail, and banking <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Common constraints:</strong> Tariffs and trade policy uncertainty were frequently cited as headwinds for manufacturing (Dallas, New York, Philadelphia) and contributed to cost pressures <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. The federal government shutdown disrupted economic activity and increased demand for social services across multiple districts, including Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. Labor availability for specific skills and rising health-care costs were also common concerns.</li>
  <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> The <em>Cleveland</em> District noted significant demand for AI data center construction boosting manufacturing, despite general softness in other industries <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>. In <em>Kansas City</em>, durable goods manufacturing strengthened slightly, contrasting with broader softness in consumer-facing services <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Signals to Watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth risks:</strong> Widespread cautious discretionary spending among consumers, especially low- and middle-income households, and ongoing economic uncertainty impacting business investment and sales expectations in districts like Dallas and St. Louis.</li>
  <li><strong>Labour inflections:</strong> Increased use of hiring freezes, replacement-only hiring, and attrition; as well as the observed impact of AI replacing entry-level positions or reducing hiring needs in Boston, Cleveland, and Philadelphia <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Inflation persistence:</strong> Continued robust nonlabor input cost pressures, particularly from tariffs, insurance, utilities, and health care, which firms anticipate will persist, despite mixed plans for price increases in the near term <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_202511.pdf" target="_blank">[Source: Federal_Reserve_Beige_Book_Summary.html]</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Capital investment:</strong> Pick-up in capital spending plans in New York manufacturing and increased investment expectations for 2026 in durable goods manufacturing in Kansas City, possibly signaling a broader re-engagement in expansion.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial stress:</strong> Rising delinquencies among households and small businesses in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Atlanta, and increasing reliance on debt to cover typical household expenses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Self-Healing</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>High-Value Inputs to Add:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Prior Beige Book release: [For more robust directional comparison beyond the national summary, enabling better trend identification.]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Weaknesses in Provided Inputs:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>OCR quality is generally good, but some words or characters were misrecognized (e.g., "The Beige Book" on page 6 often shows "The Beige Book"). Concrete fix: Provide the original PDF for better text extraction and fidelity.</li>
