<p><em>Descriptive synthesis of current US economic conditions based on district-level reporting.</em></p>
<hr>

<h3>National Backdrop</h3>
<p>Overall economic activity remained largely unchanged since the previous report, with most of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts observing little change, though two noted a modest decline and one reported modest growth (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Consumer spending saw a further decline, although higher-end retail remained resilient, with some retailers attributing negative impacts to the government shutdown and auto dealers experiencing declines in EV sales after federal tax credit expiration (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Manufacturing activity increased somewhat across most Districts, despite tariffs posing a headwind (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Revenues in the nonfinancial services sector were generally flat to down, and loan demand was mixed (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Conditions in the agriculture and energy sectors were largely stable, yet some contacts cited challenges from low prices (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Community organizations reported increased demand for food assistance, partly due to disruptions in SNAP benefits during the government shutdown (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</p>
<hr>

<h3>Labour Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Employment edged slightly lower during the reporting period, with about half of the Districts noting weaker labor demand (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). While there was an uptick in layoff announcements, more Districts indicated that firms were managing headcounts through hiring freezes, replacement-only hiring, and attrition rather than widespread layoffs (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Several employers, such as in Cleveland, adjusted workers' hours to accommodate business volume, and some firms reported that artificial intelligence was replacing entry-level positions or boosting worker productivity, thereby curbing new hiring (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Employers across most Districts found it easier to secure workers, although specific skilled positions and fewer immigrant workers remained difficult to find (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Wage growth was generally modest, with some sectors like manufacturing, construction, and health care experiencing more moderate wage pressures due to tighter labor supply (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Rising health insurance premiums continued to exert upward pressure on overall labor costs (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</p>
<hr>

<h3>Prices & Cost Pressures</h3>
<p>Prices increased moderately during the reporting period (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Input cost pressures were widespread, particularly in manufacturing and retail, largely driven by tariff-induced increases (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Many Districts, including Boston and Philadelphia, also cited rising costs for insurance, utilities, technology, and health care (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). The ability to pass through these higher input costs to customers varied, depending on demand strength, competitive pressures, and consumer price sensitivity (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). There were multiple reports of margin compression or financial strain for firms, especially those affected by tariffs, as observed in Dallas (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Conversely, prices for certain materials declined due to sluggish demand, deferred tariff implementation, or reduced tariff rates (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Looking ahead, contacts generally expect upward cost pressures to persist, but plans for near-term price increases were mixed (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</p>
<hr>

<h3>Sector Themes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer activity:</strong> Overall consumer spending declined further, though higher-end retail remained resilient, as noted in New York (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). The government shutdown and expiration of EV tax credits negatively impacted consumer purchases, particularly for lower- and middle-income households who are increasingly price-sensitive and turning to lower-cost alternatives (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Discretionary spending was notably cautious, impacting big-ticket items in Richmond and restaurant sales in St. Louis (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Manufacturing activity increased somewhat across most Districts, with some bright spots like demand related to AI infrastructure investments in Boston and Cleveland (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). However, tariffs and tariff uncertainty continued to be a significant headwind, causing declining new orders for textile manufacturers in Richmond and impacting margins for Dallas firms (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Production in some areas, like Chicago, was crimped by supply chain disruptions (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Services:</strong> Revenues in the nonfinancial services sector were mostly flat to down, with some Districts like New York reporting moderate declines in activity across various sub-sectors (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Professional and business services saw moderate demand increases in Cleveland due to tax policy changes and AI adoption (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Tourism activity was mixed, with some areas like New York City seeing stable high hotel bookings, while others like Boston noted a softening (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Housing & construction:</strong> Residential construction declined in some Districts (e.g., Dallas, Philadelphia), was unchanged in others (e.g., Chicago), and home sales activity varied (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Some Districts, like Boston, saw renewed strength in home sales attributed to lower mortgage rates (<a href="https://investorananatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Commercial real estate activity generally improved somewhat, particularly in the office market recovery in New York City and Hartford, but high construction costs and funding uncertainty continued to deter new development in many areas (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Banking & credit:</strong> Loan demand was mixed overall, with declines in general loan demand noted by small-to-medium banks in New York and Philadelphia, but increased demand for residential mortgages in some areas (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Credit standards were mostly unchanged, though some contacts reported tightening for business and commercial mortgages in New York and for consumer loans in Philadelphia (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Delinquencies generally improved but remained elevated, with an ongoing rise noted among households and small businesses in Philadelphia and St. Louis (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture & energy:</strong> Conditions in agriculture were largely stable but remained weak in some areas like Minneapolis, despite strong crop harvests, due to low prices (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Low water levels in the Mississippi River, as reported in St. Louis, caused significant reductions in barge capacity and efficiency (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). The energy sector generally saw moderate growth, driven by strong demand for primary energy sources, particularly LNG, solar, and wind, linked to data center activity in Atlanta (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Regional Dispersion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stronger districts:</strong> The <em>Chicago</em> District reported slight increases in overall economic activity, consumer spending, business spending, construction and real estate, and manufacturing (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). <em>Boston</em> observed slight economic expansion, driven by renewed strength in home sales and modest manufacturing growth tied to AI infrastructure investments (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Softer districts:</strong> <em>New York</em> and <em>Dallas</em> reported a modest decline in economic activity, with weakness concentrated in nonfinancial services, retail, and banking sectors (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). <em>Philadelphia</em>'s economy was trending down prior to further disruption from the government shutdown, resulting in modest declines across most sectors (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). <em>St. Louis</em> and <em>Kansas City</em> also noted economic activity remained unchanged or slowed slightly, amplified by demand slowdowns and the government shutdown (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Common constraints:</strong> The recent federal government shutdown was a frequently cited factor impacting consumer spending, business activity, and social services across multiple Districts, including Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Tariffs and trade policy uncertainty continued to be a pervasive headwind for manufacturing and retail input costs, leading to margin compression in Districts like Dallas, Philadelphia, and Cleveland (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Labour availability for specific skilled positions and the impact of reduced immigrant workers were noted in Districts such as Boston, New York, and St. Louis (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Rising health insurance premiums were a common cost pressure across many regions (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> In <em>Cleveland</em>, some manufacturers reported a boost from AI data centers, which became a primary driver of demand, yet this was not enough to offset softer activity in other industries (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). <em>Minneapolis</em> reported broadly flat economic activity, but residential and commercial construction, as well as manufacturing, showed slight increases (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). In <em>Kansas City</em>, durable goods manufacturing activity strengthened, driven by improvements in primary metals, fabricated metals, machinery, and transportation equipment, contrasting with general softening (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Signals to Watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth risks:</strong> Ongoing cautious discretionary spending by consumers, particularly impacting lower and middle-income households, and the effects of tariff uncertainty on manufacturing outlooks and investment decisions (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Weakness in EV sales following the expiration of federal tax credits is noted (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Labour inflections:</strong> The increasing use of AI to replace entry-level positions or enhance worker productivity, curbing new hiring, as observed in Boston and Cleveland (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Layoff announcements ticking up in some Districts, alongside a broader trend of headcount limits through attrition rather than direct layoffs (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Inflation persistence:</strong> Persistent input cost pressures from tariffs, rising health insurance premiums, utilities, and energy, with firms expecting these to continue (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). The mixed ability of businesses to pass through costs, leading to margin compression for some, while others anticipate future price increases for specific products (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Capital investment:</strong> Pick-up in capital spending plans in manufacturing in Districts like New York and Kansas City, with some firms dusting off expansion plans that were previously paused (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Conversely, continued delays in construction projects due to uncertain funding and high costs in Philadelphia and the Mountain West (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Financial stress:</strong> The ongoing rise in consumer past-dues and delinquency rates, especially among households and small businesses in Districts like Philadelphia and St. Louis, as household finances are stretched (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Small businesses struggling to obtain credit from banks and facing financial strain due to frozen contracts and funding delays (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
