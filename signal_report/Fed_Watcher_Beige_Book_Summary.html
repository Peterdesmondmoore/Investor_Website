<hr>

<h3>National Backdrop</h3>
<p>
Economic activity was little changed across most Federal Reserve Districts since the previous report, with two Districts noting a modest decline and one reporting modest growth (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Overall consumer spending declined further, though higher-end retail spending showed resilience (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Manufacturing activity increased somewhat for most Districts, but tariffs and related uncertainty remained a headwind (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Revenues in the nonfinancial services sector were mostly flat to down, and loan demand was mixed (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Conditions in the agriculture and energy sectors were largely stable, with challenges cited from a low-price environment for certain crops and oil (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Community organizations observed increased demand for food assistance, partly due to disruptions in SNAP benefits during a government shutdown (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Labour Market Conditions</h3>
<p>
Employment declined slightly, with approximately half of Districts reporting weaker labor demand (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). While layoff announcements saw an uptick, more Districts indicated employers were limiting headcounts through hiring freezes, replacement-only hiring, and attrition rather than widespread layoffs (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Some firms adjusted hours worked to manage business volume, and a few noted that artificial intelligence replaced entry-level positions or enhanced worker productivity, curbing new hiring (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Employers across most Districts found it easier to find workers, although difficulties persisted for specific skilled positions and due to fewer immigrant workers (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Wage growth generally proceeded at a modest pace; however, sectors like manufacturing, construction, and health care experienced more moderate wage pressure due to tighter labor supply and rising health insurance premiums adding to labor costs (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Prices & Cost Pressures</h3>
<p>
Prices rose moderately across the reporting period, with input cost pressures widespread, particularly in manufacturing and retail sectors, often attributed to tariffs (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Several Districts, including Boston and Cleveland, noted robust increases in non-tariff-related costs such as insurance, utilities, technology, and health care (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). The ability to pass through these higher input costs to customers varied significantly, depending on demand strength, competitive pressures, and consumer price sensitivity, leading to multiple reports of margin compression (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). While prices for some materials declined due to sluggish demand or deferred tariff implementation, firms largely anticipate ongoing upward cost pressures (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). For instance, a New York brass machining company reported facing financial strain due to tariffs, while commercial construction contacts in Cleveland gained pricing power (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).
</p>

<h3>Sector Themes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer activity:</strong> Consumer spending declined further overall, though higher-end retail remained resilient, particularly in New York and Atlanta (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Discretionary spending was cautious or reduced among lower- and middle-income consumers, with some retailers citing impacts from the government shutdown and the expiration of federal EV tax credits (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Sales at family restaurants in Chicago and St. Louis declined, with customers ordering less and trading down.</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Manufacturing activity increased slightly for most Districts, including Chicago and Boston, but generally faced headwinds from tariffs, uncertainty, and shifting international demand (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Some manufacturers, particularly in Cleveland and Atlanta, reported increased demand related to AI data center construction, while auto production was flat or declined in Dallas and Chicago due to supply disruptions and soft sales (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Services:</strong> Nonfinancial services revenues were mostly flat to down, with declines noted in New York business services and St. Louis professional services (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Leisure and hospitality activity was mixed; New York City tourism was stable, while other areas reported cautious discretionary spending, sometimes impacted by the government shutdown (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Demand for professional and business services increased moderately in Cleveland and Boston.</li>
  <li><strong>Housing & construction:</strong> Residential real estate activity varied, with declines in home sales in Atlanta and Dallas, but renewed strength in Boston due to lower mortgage rates (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Commercial real estate conditions generally improved marginally, with office market recoveries noted in New York and Boston, and strong demand for data center construction across several Districts (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Construction costs remained high due to labor shortages and tariffs, deterring some new development (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Banking & credit:</strong> Loan demand was mixed overall, with declines in commercial and industrial lending in Dallas and Philadelphia, but moderate increases in Cleveland, partly due to declining interest rates (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Credit standards were mostly unchanged, though some tightening was reported for business and commercial mortgages in New York and Philadelphia (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Credit quality remained strong for most, but delinquencies, particularly among households and small businesses, showed an ongoing rise in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Richmond (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture & energy:</strong> Agricultural conditions were largely stable but remained weak in Minneapolis and Kansas City, despite strong crop harvests (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Low crop prices and drought conditions in Dallas challenged farm finances (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Energy industry segments grew moderately, with strong demand for primary energy sources, especially LNG, solar, and wind, attributed to data center activity (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Oil and gas activity declined slightly in Kansas City due to prices falling below profitable levels (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Regional Dispersion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stronger districts:</strong> <ul><li><em>Chicago</em> and <em>Boston</em> reported slight increases in overall economic activity, driven by some manufacturing growth, resilient high-end consumer spending, and improving commercial real estate (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Boston also saw strong gains in home sales.</li></ul></li>
  <li><strong>Softer districts:</strong> <ul><li><em>New York</em>, <em>Philadelphia</em>, and <em>Dallas</em> reported modest declines or weakening in economic activity (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). These Districts frequently cited negative impacts from the government shutdown, tariff concerns, and broad-based declines in consumer and nonfinancial services.</li><li><em>Kansas City</em> also experienced a slight slowdown, reflecting softer labor and cooling consumer activity (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li></ul></li>
  <li><strong>Common constraints:</strong> <ul><li>Ongoing uncertainty regarding tariffs and trade policy impacted manufacturing and retail across multiple Districts, including Dallas, New York, and Philadelphia (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li><li>The recent government shutdown was frequently cited as a disruptor of consumer spending, social services, and business activity in Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li><li>High input costs, particularly for insurance, utilities, and health care, were a widespread concern for firms, contributing to margin compression across the country (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li></ul></li>
  <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> <ul><li>The <em>Boston</em> District noted that a data center construction boom was expected to bypass New England due to a lack of power-generating capacity, a unique regional constraint despite strong demand elsewhere (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li><li>In <em>Kansas City</em>, one firm noted that it was now "the best time to get a tattoo" due to increased artist availability, highlighting a very specific manifestation of softening discretionary consumer activity (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Signals to Watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth risks:</strong> Widespread caution in consumer discretionary spending, particularly among lower- and middle-income households, and the potential for a slower activity in coming months noted in Districts like St. Louis and Cleveland (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Labour inflections:</strong> The increasing use of hiring freezes, replacement-only hiring, and attrition over layoffs, along with Artificial Intelligence replacing entry-level positions, indicates a structural shift in hiring behavior across multiple Districts (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Inflation persistence:</strong> Ongoing upward pressure on input costs, especially from tariffs, insurance, and health care, suggests price increases may persist, even as firms struggle with passing costs to price-sensitive consumers (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Capital investment:</strong> Manufacturers in Philadelphia and Kansas City expressed optimism about future capital expenditures and dusting off expansion plans, contrasting with general business caution and some project delays in Dallas (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Financial stress:</strong> Rising delinquencies and defaults, particularly among households and small businesses in Districts like Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Richmond, suggest early signs of financial strain (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
