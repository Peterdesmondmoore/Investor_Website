<p><em>Descriptive synthesis of current US economic conditions based on district-level reporting.</em></p>
<hr>

<h3>National Backdrop</h3>
<p>
Economic activity was largely unchanged across most Federal Reserve Districts since the previous report, with two Districts reporting modest declines and one noting modest growth (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Overall consumer spending declined further, though higher-end retail segments showed resilience. The government shutdown was cited by some retailers as negatively impacting consumer purchases, and auto dealers observed declines in EV sales following the expiration of federal tax credits (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Consumer_Sentiment/" target="_blank">2</a>). Manufacturing activity increased somewhat for most Districts, despite ongoing headwinds from tariffs and associated uncertainty (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production/" target="_blank">3</a>). Revenues in the nonfinancial services sector were mostly flat to down, and loan demand was mixed (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Credit_Conditions/" target="_blank">4</a>). Conditions in agriculture and energy sectors were generally stable, though low-price environments posed challenges for some commodities (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Overall outlooks remained largely unchanged, with some contacts anticipating slower activity in the coming months, while manufacturers expressed some optimism (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Labour Market Conditions</h3>
<p>
Employment declined slightly, with approximately half of Districts reporting weaker labor demand (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labor_Market_Tightness_Signal/" target="_blank">5</a>). Despite an increase in layoff announcements, many employers opted to limit headcounts through hiring freezes, replacement-only hiring, and attrition, rather than widespread layoffs. Several firms adjusted hours worked to match business volume, and a few noted that artificial intelligence (AI) replaced entry-level positions or boosted existing worker productivity, thereby curbing new hiring (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labor_Market_Tightness_Signal/" target="_blank">5</a>). Across most Districts, finding workers became easier, though difficulties persisted for certain skilled positions and due to fewer immigrant workers. Wage growth was generally modest, but sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and health care experienced more moderate wage pressures due to tighter labor supply (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal/" target="_blank">6</a>). Additionally, rising health insurance premiums continued to exert upward pressure on labor costs (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal/" target="_blank">6</a>).
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Prices & Cost Pressures</h3>
<p>
Prices rose moderately during the reporting period (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Inflation_Signal/" target="_blank">7</a>). Input cost pressures were widespread, particularly in manufacturing and retail, largely attributed to tariff-induced increases (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Inflation_Signal/" target="_blank">7</a>). Some Districts, including Philadelphia and Cleveland, also noted robust cost growth for insurance, utilities, technology, and health care. The extent to which higher input costs were passed through to customers varied, influenced by demand conditions, competitive pressures, and consumer price sensitivity (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Inflation_Signal/" target="_blank">7</a>). Multiple reports indicated margin compression or financial strain for firms due to tariffs, such as a brass machining company in New York facing potential closure. Conversely, prices for certain materials declined, which contacts attributed to sluggish demand, deferred tariff implementation, or reduced tariff rates. Looking ahead, contacts largely anticipate persistent upward cost pressures, but plans for near-term price increases were mixed (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Inflation_Signal/" target="_blank">7</a>).
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Sector Themes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumer activity:</strong> Overall consumer spending declined further across most Districts, with lower- and middle-income consumers showing increased financial stress and caution in discretionary spending (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Consumer_Sentiment/" target="_blank">2</a>). For example, Cleveland noted early signs of strain on middle-income consumers, and Atlanta reported higher-income consumer spending remaining resilient as others pulled back. Higher-end retail spending remained resilient nationally (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Government shutdown and expiring EV tax credits negatively impacted auto sales and broader consumer purchases in Districts like St. Louis and Dallas.</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Manufacturing activity was mixed, increasing somewhat in Districts like Chicago and Boston, but declining modestly in Richmond and Philadelphia (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production/" target="_blank">3</a>). Tariffs and related uncertainty continued to be significant headwinds for manufacturers across multiple Districts, impacting planning and profitability, especially in Dallas. Demand related to AI infrastructure investments provided a boost to some manufacturers, particularly in Cleveland (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production/" target="_blank">3</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Services:</strong> Revenues in the nonfinancial services sector were mostly flat to down (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). Professional and business services saw moderate growth in Cleveland due to tax law changes and AI adoption, while New York reported moderate declines in its service sector. Community support organizations across various Districts, including Atlanta and San Francisco, noted increased demand for food assistance due to the government shutdown and SNAP benefit disruptions (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Housing & construction:</strong> Residential construction activity varied, declining in some areas like Philadelphia and Dallas, but unchanged or slightly up in others like Boston and Chicago (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Housing_Lead/" target="_blank">8</a>). Home sales showed renewed strength in Boston due to lower mortgage rates, while New York's high-end housing market remained strong. Commercial real estate generally improved, with office markets recovering in New York and Boston, and strong demand for data center construction noted in Cleveland (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Housing_Lead/" target="_blank">8</a>). High construction costs and labor shortages continued to deter some development.</li>
  <li><strong>Banking & credit:</strong> Loan demand was mixed overall, with some Districts like New York reporting declines in general loan demand but a slight increase in residential mortgages (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Credit_Conditions/" target="_blank">4</a>). Philadelphia banks saw commercial and industrial loans decline, while Cleveland reported moderately increased loan demand. Delinquencies and defaults were noted as rising, particularly for households and small businesses in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Credit_Conditions/" target="_blank">4</a>). Credit standards were largely unchanged but tightened for certain categories.</li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture & energy:</strong> Conditions were largely stable but challenging (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>). The energy industry in Atlanta saw moderate growth, driven by demand for primary energy sources related to data centers. However, oil and gas activity declined slightly in Kansas City and Dallas due to falling oil prices below profitable levels. Agricultural conditions remained weak in Minneapolis and Kansas City despite strong harvests or crop price increases, with narrow profit opportunities. Drought conditions worsened in Dallas.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Regional Dispersion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stronger districts:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chicago:</strong> Economic activity increased slightly, with broad-based gains in employment, consumer spending, business spending, construction, real estate, and manufacturing (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>Boston:</strong> Economic activity expanded slightly, buoyed by renewed strength in home sales and modest growth in manufacturing sales (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Softer districts:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New York:</strong> Economic activity declined modestly, characterized by a slight fall in employment and consumer spending (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>Philadelphia:</strong> Economic activity was already trending down before further disruption from the government shutdown, leading to modest declines across most sectors (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>Dallas:</strong> Economic activity weakened slightly, with declines observed in nonfinancial services, retail, and banking (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>Kansas City:</strong> Economic growth slowed slightly, reflecting softer labor conditions and cooling consumer activity (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Common constraints:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tariff impacts:</strong> Widespread input cost pressures, particularly in manufacturing and retail, leading to margin compression and pricing uncertainty (National Summary, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Inflation_Signal/" target="_blank">7</a>)).</li>
      <li><strong>Government shutdown effects:</strong> Amplified demand slowdowns, disrupted operations, and negatively impacted consumer spending and social services in multiple Districts (National Summary, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Dallas (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>)).</li>
      <li><strong>Consumer price sensitivity & budget constraints:</strong> Particularly impacting low- and middle-income households, leading to reduced discretionary spending and a search for lower-priced items (Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, San Francisco (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Consumer_Sentiment/" target="_blank">2</a>)).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Outliers:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI impact on labor:</strong> Firms in Cleveland, Philadelphia, and San Francisco noted AI replacing entry-level positions or boosting productivity, which curbed new hiring (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labor_Market_Tightness_Signal/" target="_blank">5</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>Data center construction boom:</strong> This drove significant demand in manufacturing and commercial real estate in Districts such as Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production/" target="_blank">3</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Signals to Watch</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth risks:</strong> Observed signs include continued softening in overall demand, amplified by government policy uncertainty and rising interest rates (St. Louis, Dallas (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Fed_Watcher_Beige_Book_Summary/" target="_blank">1</a>)). Persistent weakness in consumer discretionary spending, especially among lower- and middle-income segments (Cleveland, Atlanta, San Francisco (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Consumer_Sentiment/" target="_blank">2</a>)). Ongoing tariff-related uncertainty continues to impact manufacturing investment and export demand (New York, Dallas (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production/" target="_blank">3</a>)).</li>
  <li><strong>Labour inflections:</strong> Increased use of hiring freezes, attrition, and adjusted hours to manage headcounts in lieu of layoffs (National Summary, Cleveland (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labor_Market_Tightness_Signal/" target="_blank">5</a>)). AI adoption reducing demand for entry-level positions and enhancing worker productivity (National Summary, Philadelphia, San Francisco (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labor_Market_Tightness_Signal/" target="_blank">5</a>)). While worker availability eased in most sectors, persistent difficulty in filling skilled positions remains (National Summary, San Francisco (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Labor_Market_Tightness_Signal/" target="_blank">5</a>)).</li>
  <li><strong>Inflation persistence:</strong> Contacts note ongoing robust nonlabor input cost increases, including tariffs, insurance, and utilities (Cleveland, Philadelphia, Atlanta (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Inflation_Signal/" target="_blank">7</a>)). Plans for price pass-through remain mixed, with some firms absorbing costs due to competitive pressures or demand softness (Cleveland, Philadelphia, Kansas City (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/US_Inflation_Signal/" target="_blank">7</a>)). Rising health insurance premiums continue to exert upward pressure on labor costs (National Summary, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Wage_Growth_and_Inflation_Signal/" target="_blank">6</a>)).</li>
  <li><strong>Capital investment:</strong> Moderate increases in capital expenditures were noted, particularly in automation and AI-related infrastructure (Chicago, Boston, Cleveland (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Industrial_Production/" target="_blank">3</a>)). Manufacturers in Philadelphia and Kansas City expect increased orders and shipments over the next six months, potentially leading to increased capital expenditures. Caution among commercial clients about investing, despite anticipated declining interest rates, was reported in Cleveland (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Credit_Conditions/" target="_blank">4</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Financial stress:</strong> Observed early stress indicators include rising delinquencies and defaults, particularly among households and small businesses (Philadelphia, St. Louis, Richmond (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Credit_Conditions/" target="_blank">4</a>)). Small businesses in Districts like Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco are struggling with access to credit and funding sources, exacerbated by policy changes and government shutdowns (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Credit_Conditions/" target="_blank">4</a>). Bankers in Dallas expect continued deterioration in loan performance over the next six months, citing financial and economic uncertainty (<a href="https://investoranatomy.com/signal_report/Credit_Conditions/" target="_blank">4</a>).</li>
